# Inheritance and 2 Weird Tricks That a/A Doesn't Want You To Know?!?! ðŸ¤ª

## Inheritance

Conceptually, class inheritance works the same way in Python as it did in JavaScript

-   Parent/Child relationships
-   Passing down methods
-   Using `super` to access the parent

The difference lies in the syntax

In JS, to make a child from a parent, we use the `extends` keyword when creating the class.

The child class then calls super in its constructor, passing in any variables found in the parent constructor

```js
// js
class Animal {
    constructor(name, sound) {
        this.name = name;
        this.sound = sound;
    }

    speak() {
        return `${this.name} says ${this.sound}`;
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    constructor(name) {
        super(name, 'woof'); //default sound
    }
}

const myDog = new Dog('callie');
console.log(myDog.speak());
```

In Python, there's no keyword to create a Parent/Child relationship. Instead, we simply pass the parent like an argument to the child class

```py
class Animal:
    pass


class Dog(Animal):
    pass
```

Python still uses super, but it works a little differently.

`super()` is a function that can access the methods of the parent class being passed to the child.

All of the methods available on the parent, including the "constructor" `__init__` method, can be called through `super()`

```py
super().method_name()
```

Since creating a child class requires using the parent's constructor arguments, child classes nearly always follow this format

```py
# py
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name, sound):
        self.name = name
        self.sound = sound


class Dog(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name):
        super().__init__(name, 'woof')
```

But don't be fooled into thinking this is special syntax specific to `__init__()`!

Think of `super()` as nothing more than an object of the parent class. Anything on that parent object can be used through `super()`

However, you don't **_need_** to use super to call a parent method on a child instance. You only need it if you're calling a parent method **in the child class definition**

```py
class Parent:
    def test(self):
        print('I am a parent class')

    def big_method(self):
        print("This method originated from the parent")

    def medium_method(self):
        print('Did you get me to print?')


class Child(Parent):
    def test(self):
        print('I am a child class')
        super().test()

    def small_method(self):
        super().big_method()


child = Child()
child.test()
child.small_method()
child.medium_method()
```

# The secrets of my people...Class/Instance/Static Variables and Methods

For some reason a/A didn't give you a reading on this content, and then gave you problems that require your knowledge of them. So here we go!

## Class & Instance Variables

Created on the class and accessed through `self.variable_name` or `Class.variable_name`

```py
class Example:
    a_class_variable = "Hello there!"

    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def test_method(self):
        print(self.a_class_variable)


my_instance = Example("Zaviar")

my_instance.test_method() # Hello there!
print(Example.a_class_variable) # Hello there!
```

Modifying a class variable on the class will update it for all instances

```py
class Example:
    a_class_variable = "Hello there!"

    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def test_method(self):
        print(self.a_class_variable)


my_instance = Example("Zaviar")
my_instance.test_method()  # Hello there!

Example.a_class_variable = "Goodbye now!"

print(Example.a_class_variable)  # Goodbye now!
my_instance.test_method()  # Goodbye now!
```

Modifying it on an INSTANCE will not update all instances

-   Instead, creates a brand new variable on the instance

```py
class Example:
    a_class_variable = "Hello there!"

    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def test_method(self):
        print(self.a_class_variable)


my_instance = Example("Zaviar")
other_instance = Example("Anthony")

other_instance.a_class_variable = "Goodbye now!"


other_instance.test_method()  # Goodbye now!
print(Example.a_class_variable)  # Hello there!
my_instance.test_method()  # Hello there!
```

If you want a class variable to be constant, convention is to make it all uppercase `A_CLASS_VARIABLE`

Remember `__slots__`? That was a class variable. It holds instance variables, and prevents overwriting/creating class variables on an instance

```py
class Example:
    __slots__ = ['name']

    a_class_variable = "Hello there!"

    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def test_method(self):
        print(self.a_class_variable)


my_instance = Example("Zaviar")
my_instance.a_class_variable = "Goodbye" # Attribute Error: Read-only
Example.a_class_variable = "Goodbye" # Works fine
```

## Class & Static Methods

Both methods can be called on the class OR on an instance

-   Instance is ignored and the main class is used

### `@classmethod` is a decorator to create a class method

-   First argument must be `cls`
    -   Just like `self` with other methods
-   `cls` is the class itself, and can be used to create instances

-   Has access to **_class variables_** through `cls`

```py
class Example:
    a_class_variable = "Hello there!"

    def __init__(self, args, that_the, class_needs):
        self.args = args,
        self.that_the = that_the,
        self.class_needs = class_needs

    @classmethod
    def new_instance_creator(cls, args, that_the, class_needs):
        print(cls.a_class_variable)  # "Hello there!" - Class variable
        print(cls.args)  # Error - Instance variable
        print(cls.that_the)  # Error - Instance variable
        print(cls.class_needs)  # Error - Instance variable
```

### `@staticmethod` is a decorator to create a static method

-   No mandatory first argument

-   Don't have access to class variables by default

    -   If you want to interact with the class/instance, you have to pass it as an argument

-   Often is passed instances

```py
class Example:
    a_class_variable = "Hello there!"

    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    @staticmethod
    def my_static_method(*args):
        return [instance.name for instance in args]


z = Example("Zaviar")
a = Example("Anthony")

print(z.my_static_method(z, a)) # ['Zaviar', 'Anthony']

print(Example.my_static_method(a)) # ['Anthony']
```

## When should I use one over the other?

They do similar things so it can be hard to know when to use one over the other

Generally:

-   `@classmethod` is used when creating a class "factory"

    -   Use the `cls` argument to create multiple instances

-   `@staticmethod` is used when creating a utility function
    -   Often times performing a calculation

```py
class Item:

    def __init__(self, name, cost):
        self.name = name
        self.cost = cost

    def __repr__(self):
        return f'< class Item | name: {self.name}, cost: ${self.cost} >'

    @classmethod
    def bulk_create_items(cls, *args):
        return [cls(name, cost) if cost else cls(name, 10)
                for name, cost in args]

    @staticmethod
    def total_cost(*args):
        return f'${sum([el.cost for el in args])}'


milk, chair, shirt = Item.bulk_create_items(
    ('Milk', 3), ('Chair', 15), ("T-shirt", None))

print(milk)  # < class Item | name: Milk, cost: $3 >
print(chair)  # < class Item | name: Chair, cost: $15 >
print(shirt)  # < class Item | name: T-shirt, cost: $10 >

cart_total = Item.total_cost(milk, chair, shirt)
print(cart_total)  # $28
```
