### First class objects review

- Functions in Python are first-class objects, meaning that they can be assigned to variables, stored in data structures, passed as arguments to other functions, or even returned as values from other functions.

## Decorators

- Decorators are used to wrap another function so we can extend the behavior of another function
- Decorating a function does not modify the function we are wrapping
