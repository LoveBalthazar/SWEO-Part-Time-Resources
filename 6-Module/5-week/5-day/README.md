# Python Group Project Planning

## Daily Planning Schedule

The following schedule is a general guideline for how to proceed with project planning.

You do not need to follow this schedule exactly! We prefer to you to take time with your planning - it is ok to turn in your docs after their "due" dates.

Submit your design docs for review by tagging your project lead in your group slack channel with a link to your GitHub wiki page.
