# M5W3D2 Redux

## [Redux Docs](https://react-redux.js.org/)

## What is Redux?
- Redux is a Javascript framework for managing the frontend state of an application


## Why Redux?
- It allows us to store information in an organized manner in our application (which is extremely useful for large scale apps)
- The library itself is lightweight and only takes up 2 kbs of space
- The time to insert or retrieve data is low (It is very fast)
- It is predictable(produces the same effects, makes it more manageable)

## When Redux > context?
- Largescale applications that require more management and maintaining
- More Complex projects that require you to stay extremely organized

## Main Components of Redux (That We Will Use)
- Store
    - Redux stores state in a single store
- Actions
    - Actions are how you update your state
    - Actions Are dispatched with an object to update
    - When an action is dispatched your reducer is invoked with said action
- Reducer
    - Reducers are a function that handles your action
    - Reducers recieve the action that was dispacthed and updates state accordingly
- Thunks
    - Thunks are normally where we make our fetches to our api
    - A Thunk in CS is a function whose primary purpose is to call another function
    - Are Thunk will be used to make our API call, get the data from that API call then will dispatch our Action
