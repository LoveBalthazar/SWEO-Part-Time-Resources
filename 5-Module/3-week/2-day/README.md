# Class Components

# Long Practice: Refactoring Widgets (3 hours)

- React used to use Class components which used the ES6 Javascript class, but in version 16.8 they introduced Function components and hooks (what you learned the last 2 weeks)
- They believed that function components and hooks would have a lower barrier of entry and would make React more accessible to developers.
- Some companies are still using the legacy class components as their codebases were developed before React 16.8 and modernizing their codebase to React 16.8 is a very time consuming and expensive task.
- The goal of this long practice is to give you exposure to legacy class components, as some companies that still use legacy class components will have interview questions based around these legacy components. You will be learning how to convert class components to function components to be able to read legacy React code.
