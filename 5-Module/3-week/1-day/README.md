## Resources allowed

For this assessment, you may use the following resources:

* [AppAcademy Open]
* [MDN]
* A whiteboard or paper to work out problems/code, but they must be within
  camera range
* VScode or a console for testing and experimentation during any part of the
  test, including multiple-choice questions
* Previously written code you wrote yourself
  * Except for code from previous assessment submissions
* Comments within code
  * If there are comments in your code about your specific code and about what
    your code is doing, that is appropriate. If your comments are about concepts
    and based on the readings, then that counts as notes. Those would not be
    appropriate.

* Official documentation including:

  * [React Docs]
  * [React Beta Docs]
  * [React Router Docs]
  * [React Learning Objectives]
  * [React Hooks Cheatsheet]

## Resources NOT allowed

* Slack
* Discord
* Google / other search engines
* StackOverflow, etc.
* GeeksForGeeks, or any tutorial site
* Notes
* Code from previous assessment submissions

## Helpful links

* [Stress, tests, and time management]
* [Polya's problem-solving framework]
* [Debugging Basics]
* [Reading Documentation]
* [Asking Questions] - While you can't get an answer during the test, it's often
  very helpful to formulate a question carefully, then try and answer it
  yourself!
* [Code of Conduct]

# Assessment Tips

- Don't spend a lot of time on the MC, it is worth very little points compared to the test specs.
- Go through the MC and if you know the answer then answer it, but if you don't just skip over it and come back to it once you have finished the coding specs.
- In general, if you are getting stuck on a spec/phase for more than a few minutes without progress then move onto the next spec/phase.
- Phase 2 is the longest/hardest part as it involves a lot of different steps and covers a few different react topics. Complete what you can, but know when to move on to another phase if you get stuck for too long.
- Remember to ask for clarifications if you don't understand what the goal of a certain phase or instruction is. We are not testing you on english comprehension but on React.
