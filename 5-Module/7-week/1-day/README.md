# Question Asking
- During this project, you will be required to create effective questions. In a professional environment, knowing when to ask for help and not spending too much time on any one problem is critical. The effectiveness of being a Software Engineer can be proportional to your ability to ask effective questions. Additionally, making the most out of the time with your manager or Senior Engineers is also vital.

- Questions should be asked in Slack. When asking a question, please post all of the following:

    - What you are working on?
    - A description of the problem.
    - What the error messages says on the server/front-end/browser consoles.
    - A relevant screenshot of code.
    - The debugging process youâ€™ve done so far (THIS IS VERY HELPFUL TO DESCRIBE).
    - This process allows your instructors to help as many people as possible. The other students in your cohort will also have great ideas for solutions. Further, it will   - allow us to know if multiple students are having similar issues and if so we can have a group session to clarify if necessary.

- DO NOT REQUEST AN INSTRUCTOR TO COME TO YOUR ROOM

- An instructor will either:

    - Help you by posting in Slack based on your question.
    - Ask you to push your code to a Github debugging branch.
    - Come to your room. Please do not ask them to come to your room!
- The option chosen will depend on the instructor's assessment of the type of problem you are having.

- Instructors will not pair program with you or build your project for you!

- Once the issue that you requested assistance with is no longer blocking your progress, instructors will move on to help other students. If you have an additional issue, please be prepared to make an additional post on Slack.

- Any third party npm packages that you use will be your responsibility. Instructors are not responsible or expected to learn your particular package. You may ask questions about them, but they may or may not have answers based on your package.
