## React Router Objectives

- Create routes using components from the react-router-dom package
- Generate navigation links using components from the react-router-dom package
- Use React Router params to access path variables
- Use React Router history to programmatically change the browser's URL
- Redirect users by using the <Redirect> component

## What is a React Router
- A react router is a front end routing library that gives us the ability to render certain components at certain URL path's
- Just like our backend sends resources and specefic request url's, React will render certain components at url paths defined in your REACT Router.
