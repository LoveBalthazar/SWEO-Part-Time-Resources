# Project Presentations (45-60 minutes)

## Prep time - Read Mod 4 Project Presentations in AAO, under Monday's content (20 minutes)

- RESET DB before you present, DB's should be fresh to avoid random bugs.
- `heroku restart && heroku pg:reset DATABASE --confirm <name-of-app> && heroku run npm run sequelize db:migrate && heroku run npm run sequelize db:seed:all`

- Presentations should be no longer than 5-10 minutes.
- Pick 1-3 routes that you would like to talk about.
- Some things you can talk about:
    - Routes or db models/migrations you struggled with
    - Unique/creative ways of solving a problem
    - Code that you are proud of
    - Ways you made your code DRY
    - Clean code you would like to show off
- Some non-coding specific topics:
    - General struggles you had about the project
    - What did you learn about yourself?
    - What tools helped you organize your time more efficiently?

## Final Grading (1-2 hours)

- Once you are done presenting, you will need to reset your DB one more time.
- I will be grading projects, during this time you can start on tuesday's homework (there is a lot), we will go over the homework on Tuesday.
