- Remember to do your reports! (even Saturday has one)
- DISREGARD the time they put on the homework for the reading, don't feel pressured by it, not accurate. Go at your own pace and it's <span style="color:#cd1d1d;">**VERY IMPORTANT TO RUN THE EXAMPLE AND BREAK / EXPERIMENT w/ the CODE**</span> 
  - Are we doing any active learning along our passive learning?

## Quizzes - 8 min
- `aa_update`
- in the `code-it-out` folder
- do: `inheritance-frq.js` file

## Employee / Manager Project - 35 minutes

## Polymorphism Review
- Go over Terminologies

## Review Terminologies 

## Practice Assessment
- Quite harder and more confusing than the real assessment
- Haven't learned yet, won't be on the assessment:
  - `context`: what does `this` represent once the function is executed / once an instance is created? Where does `this` belong (who owns `this`)
