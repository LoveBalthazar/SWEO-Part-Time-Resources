WRITE YOUR ANSWER HERE:
i.e. The main concept of OOP is the idea that we can identify, group, and organize data (properties) and behaviors (methods) under a tool like classes. As your program gets bigger, classes & oop becomes a better to use use to help group information and scale the project

ex: person class that contains information and behaviors of people (eyeColor, age, gender, cry(), walk(), befriend())
