### Classes and OOP

What is `OOP`?

- `Object Oriented Programming` is a design pattern that helps to break down large, complex problems into simpler pieces.
- The **main concept** behind `OOP` is the idea that you can group data and related actions together and treat them as a single entity within a larger system.
- The characteristics of an `object` are called `properties` or `attributes` of the object. (*keys and values that are just data*)
- The actions of the `object` are called `methods`. (*the objects functions*)
- If it helps, you can think of `properties` as an `object`'s 'Adjectives' and `methods` as the 'Verbs'.

What is a `class`?

- A `class` is a blueprint for creating objects
- A instance of a `class` is an `object` with all the properties and methods defined
  on the `class`
- Some of our favorite datatypes such as `Array`, and `Object` are classes. For
  example the method `someArray.forEach()` is callable in this way because it is
  an instance method defined on the class `Array`.
  - [Array Constructor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Array)
  - Notice how we can create an array using the `new` keyword

Why does OOP use Classes?

- Classes are a clean way to `Encapsulate` our code.
- They provide an API that hides the internal complexity(logic) and manages the data of our `object`
- Classes allow us to model real world entities in an organized way

### Encapsulation

- `Encapsulation` means to put behavior and data together behind an API that hides the implementation details.
- We dont need to know how it works, we just need to know how to use it.
- Basically it's configuring your code to hide the complexity of a behavior in an API.

Say you're on Amazon and you want to order a bottle of perfume. The steps you might take are

- click on perfume
- add to cart
- checkout

you dont need to know all of the steps that amazon has to take in order for its website to load the page for the perfume, add the item to your cart, recieve payment and setup shipping, etc., you just need to know what you have to do in order to acheive your goal. That is encapsulation. Hiding the details and only making you deal with the need to know.

## Classes and Inheritance Demo

## Project Time! (until the end of class)

- Make sure you ask questions if you get stuck!
- every phase has its own section in open, but they are all the same project. You only need to download it once.
