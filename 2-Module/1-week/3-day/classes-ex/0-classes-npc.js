// Classes are just special functions that are like blueprints / template that we then use in order to create INSTANCES (objects from that blueprint)

// Classes allow us to identify, group, and organize related data (good for bigger applications)

// we just feed the class raw data, and it will create the object for us

console.log("----------MonsterNPC Class---------")
// I am creating a game and I want to create NPC that contain certain data and behaviors
