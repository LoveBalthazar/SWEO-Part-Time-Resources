# W7D1 - Tuesday

## Assessment (1h50m)

- You can always use the node to test code and reference homework on AA-Open for content!

- Remember, looking things up can slow you down. I highly recommend that you try the problem with your own knowledge first to the best of your ability, then reference material to double check (especially for FRQs)

- <span style="color:#cd1d1d;">**VERY IMPORTANT**</span>: run `mocha` before submitting! Any syntax or code failures can result in a zero if `mocha` doesn't work!! The mocha tests are your grade for those coding questions!

- If the prompt states to do it recursively, then recursion must be done. Otherwise, we don't need recursion.
  
- Please start submission process early (preferrably 10 minutes before assessment ends).

### Coding Portion Advice

- <span style="color:#cd1d1d;">Polya Plan (start)</span>: If we don't know where to begin or start:
  - always check the **inputs** and **outputs**, 
  - **write a short plan** in english (the what) then implement it (the how)
  - Try to break what you want to do down into smaller steps (each step should be as close to code as possible)

-  <span style="color:#cd1d1d;">Debugger + Debugging Techniques(stuck)</span>: If we're stuck in the middle of a bug, try:

    - console.logs key data & variables,
    - commenting things out to isolate the bug,
    - debugger

- If we're unable to get started on a question after 10 minutes, don't stare down the code, move on to the next question and come back later.  
  - If you're spending too much time **STARING DOWN YOUR CODE**, or you're having anxiety, panicking, etc. then <span style="color:#cd1d1d;">ask us a question on live channel</span> to help clarify the prompt even if you think you understood it.

## Assessment Specs

- 1 MCQ
- 3 FRQ
- 2 Coding Specs (6 points possible)
- Must get 8/10 to pass!

## Welcome to Module 2!

- Intro to Module 2
- The remaining readings and short exercises for Tuesday
- Feel free to take a look at the project (Rock Paper Scissors ...), but we **are not starting it** until tomorrow (pair project)

## Early start on Homework

- <span style="color:#cd1d1d;">**VERY IMPORTANT**</span>: If we are not doing or not relying on the homework this week, we will fail the assessment! Please do the homework!
  - <span style="color:#cd1d1d;">Reverse classroom style</span> is going to be the <span style="color:#cd1d1d;">theme of this module</span>
  - The assessment is **all multiple choice** and very heavy on the conceptual content (DRY, Single Responsibility Principle, Classes - Object oriented Programming)
    - Putting code in the node repl won't work and won't solve your MCs since it's more conceptual in nature.
	
## End of Day

- **Passive Learning** - introduction / shows us `what is possible`
  - Examples
    - Videos
    - Talking lectures
    - Readings
    - Articles, Documentation, etc.
    - Multiple Choice
  - Passive learning is easy, we're just consuming data (pushing data on)

- **Active learning** - confirms that we understand, learn, and how we can apply `what is possible` using our memory and cognitive analysis
  - Examples
    - Coding
    - `Explaining` concepts / what weâ€™ve `learned` in `our own words`
      - FRQs
        - Try w/ our own knowledge first
        - If we search or look up the answer right away without trying, we have already lost the active learning battle.
      - Answering Questions / Participating
      - Drawing out models, plans, visuals, etc.
      - Flash Cards (without choices)
  - Active learning is hard, we're confirming and testing our understanding of the material (pulling data out of our head).

- WE **NEED BOTH** in coding.
  - Remember to ask ourselves if we are doing any active learning after our passive learning?
