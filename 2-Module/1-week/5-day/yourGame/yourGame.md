# You're own interative class game

Please do this exercise during our week off to keep your brain in gear!

Create a monster.js file in this directory to begin.

Please copy this folder and paste it above in one of your folders so you don't lose your code. I want you to create a Monster (or another generic character) class. Your default Monster should have at least 5 properties (or attributes) and a minimum of 3 methods (actions) that make this character interactive and update it's properties in some way. You should create at least 1 static variable and 1 static method of your choice. One of your static methods should take in at least 1 instance and use that instance's information in some way.

After you create your monster class, I want you to create a new file in this folder and create a specialized character from that original class (for exampled a vampire is a kind of monster). This character will inherit from the main class you created. I want you to add 2 extra properties to this character in addition to the properties needed for the original class. This character should have at least 2 instance methods, one static method, and one method created with polymorphism in mind.

After you've created your specialized character if you'd like to continue and create more specialized character classes to interact with your current character class, you can! create a new file and import all of your classes into it. I'd like you to create at least 5 instances of your characters and have them interact with each other using your methods and properties. Have fun with this! (Feel free to add worlds or something using the adventure game as a reference and have your characters traverse these worlds!)

After you've completed this project, please review your code and look for opportunities to refactor to keep your code DRY and make sure you're using the SRP (all your functions are focused on a single action.)

If you need inspiration, please refer to the fightingGame created in m2>w1>4d or the adventure game from m2>w1>5d.
