## TDD Twitter Lite Pair Programming! (1hr30m)
- If we've already done most of it, redo, but do not reference any solution. 
  - **IMPORTANT:** If we already know the answer, help our pair come to the same conclusion, don't just give the answer out! 
  - Also practice our explanation abilities, breaking down to our pair what the test specs are doing, and using evidence to back our claim (documentation)
    - I.e. so this spec is describing that our code we are testing should have these properties through the .property method on the chai library (then parse the chai library to look up that method)

- remember the 2 great strategies when we aren't sure why our code isn't passing the test specs:
  - `commenting tests out` until we can `isolate the failing one`
  - ` running the examples` provided `from the test specs` into `class file and running node`

### Assessment Break Down
- Length: 2hr 25m
- **6 mc - 6 points**
  - Classes
  - Context
  - TDD Concepts
  - MISC Javascript Concepts we've learned
- **Coding Challenge - 13 points**
  - Be able to write classes from scratch using OOP concepts 
  - Be able to read test specs and build the said above (build classes from reading mocha specs)
- Passing score **15/19**
- Ask ourselves: Am I confident in building classes right now using OOP & classes concepts like constructor, instance methods, inheritance, etc. FROM ONLY TEST SPECS?
  - If you can do this with minimal amount of reference / looking up syntax, you're in good shape 
  - If we have trouble doing this and writing the syntax. Go over:
    - Syntax and basics: `dragon project`, `employee manager` (up until bonus, don't have to do bonus)
    - `Practice Assessment`
    - `Twitter Lite`
- Know the syntax so we can allocate our time, brain power, and resources to solving problems rather than trying to look up a certain syntax.
