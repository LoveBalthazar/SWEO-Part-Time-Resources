## Determining Test Cases

There are 2 main reasons for test specs.

- To specify what should be built.
  - created before the code is written to help the dev know what to build.
- To prevent people from breaking your code in the future
  - As long as you have good test specs, updates and upgrades wont break your code.

## Project Time

Today is going to be mostly practice, no new concepts being introduced. You'll continue your project from yesterday with your partner, then tackle the tic tac toe challenge. Take your time and have fun with this one!
