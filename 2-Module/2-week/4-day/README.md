# M2W2D4 (TDD Practice)

## TDD Pair Programming
- TDD Style Project phase 3-4
- Focus more on phase 4 - testing classes (you can go out of order)


## Practice Building Classes From Tests (Solo - Cams On)
- Building Twitter Lite!
- TDD Read Tests Specs / Test File and Write Classes

- inside the `twitter-lite-tdd` folder, open `README.md` and code out the classes from the test specs.

- HINTs: 
  - Comment out the tests one by one to see which one you are failing. 
  - another option is to run the examples (i.e. the ones provided here) in the corresponding class file to test.
  - Remember your exports and imports!

- Remember to have cams on and screensharing during solo time, we'll be going around to make sure everyone is good and set

## Homework
- Continue on Twitter Lite
- Look over friday's content
- Go over the `employee and manager salaries` project
  - From the test specs and reading the test files, could you write the classes for that project?
