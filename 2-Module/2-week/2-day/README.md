## Learning Boost (5m)

## Assessment Break Down
- Length: 2hr 25m
- **6 mc - 6 points**
  - Classes
  - Context
  - TDD Concepts
  - MISC Javascript Concepts we've learned
- **Coding Challenge - 13 points**
  - Be able to write classes from scratch using OOP concepts 
  - Be able to read test specs and build the said above (build classes from reading mocha specs)
- Passing score **15/19**
- Ask ourselves: Am I confident in building simple Employee / Manager classes right now using constructor, instance methods, inheritance, etc?
  - If you can do this with minimal amount of reference / looking up syntax, you're in good shape 
  - If we have trouble doing this and writing the syntax. Go back to the `employee project` or `friendly & evil dragon` project to practice syntax drilling
    - When should we be confident in our class skills? When we are able to write classes and apply OOP concepts with little to no references
  - Know the syntax so we can allocate our time, brain power, and resources to solving problems rather than trying to look up a certain syntax.
  - We'll be doing more class related `code-it-out` problems during class later this week
