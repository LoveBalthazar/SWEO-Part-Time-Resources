Testing Pyramid

- Unit Tests: Smallest unit of testing. Focuses on individual functions or tasks
  individually.
- Integration Tests: Testing how separate pieces of code work with one another.
- End-to-End Tests: Tests the whole application, high level functionality, close
  to the user experience.

TDD Process

- Red: Write tests, watch them fail
- Green: Write code, just enough to pass the previously written tests.
- Refactor: Write more tests, watch them fail, pass the tests. The loop of
  easily maintainable, fully tested, clean code.

## Pair Programming
- TDD Style Project phase 1-2

## Homework
- Not a lot of homework tonight but we're adding a challenge
- Go over the `employee and manager salaries` project
- From the test specs and reading the test files, could you write the classes for that project?
