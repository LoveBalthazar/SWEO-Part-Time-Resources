//RAM
//Random access memory
//Stores processes that are currently running

//When RAM runs out of memory storage to run programs
//it pushes them into the hard drive and that is why your computer starts running slower

//Arrays and Stacks

//The most fundamental data structure
//very elegant and efficient

//Array indexing is the fastest way to access data
//Arrays store their elements in memory next to each other, so there's no wasted space

//Stacks
//First in, Last out

//PUSH
//We always push items on top of the stack

//POP
//We always pop off the top

//Usually under the hood we implement stacks with arrays
