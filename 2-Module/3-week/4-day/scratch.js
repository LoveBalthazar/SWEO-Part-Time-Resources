//RAM
//Random access memory

//IT IS A HARDWARE COMPONENT

//Stores data that is currently in use
//RAM is super fast but that makes it more expensive

//If ram starts to fill up we start pushing processes into the hard drive

//Hard drive
//Slower than ram, less expesive, however the data can persist without power

//Arrays and Stacks
//The are the most fundamental data structure
//Super elegant and very efficient

//Space wise arrays are stored with every element
//right next to eachother with no wasted space

//Regarding time, array indexing is constant time so it's as fast as you can get
