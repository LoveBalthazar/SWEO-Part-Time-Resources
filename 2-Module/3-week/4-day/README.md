## Code-it-out
- part 1: do `binaryToDecimal.js`
  - remember. Binary is just a counting system that is like decimal, but can only go up to 1!
  - We use binary in computers because it can easily be represented by electricity: on(1) or off(0)
    - imagine trying to represent electricity as 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9...
- part 2: do `binaryToAscii.js`
- part 3: do `decimalToAscii.js`
- part 4: do `hexadecimals.js`

- All the base systems are just ways to count. They all get translated to binary for computers to read.
  

## So... How do we get images, colors, videos, etc. ?
- Character Encoding Standards
  - Allow us to map numbers to characters
  - ex:
    - the **decimal number** `65` in ascii standard represents the letter `A`
    - the **binary number** `01000001` represents also the letter `A`
- images, and colors? ... [cs50](https://youtu.be/1tnj3UCkuxU?t=1531) 
  - Why is the file size so big for this video?
    - It could be using more colors, more frames, more pixels, so therefore we need more BITS (0 or 1)!
  
  - Essentially the same. We build programs that just map binary to things that we want. Whether its characters, colors, images, etc. Everything is built from 0s and 1s.
