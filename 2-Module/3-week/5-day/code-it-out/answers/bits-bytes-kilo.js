/*
we've been working with bits, and a byte is 8 bits... but there's more
- Conversion
    - 1 byte ~ 8 bits 
    - 1 kilobyte ~ 1000 bytes 
    - 1 megabyte ~ 1000 kilobytes
    - 1 gigabyte ~ 1000 megabytes
    - ...reference your homework for more!

// QUESTION: How many bits are in 1 gigabyte?
// ANSWER: 80 million bits.
// math: 1 gig = 1000 megabytes = 1million kilobytes = 10million bytes (1 byte is 8 bits, so if we have 10m byte, that's 10m x 8)= 80million bits.
