console.log("----Bits, Bytes, Kilobytes, megabytes... too many to byte----")
/*
we've been working with bits, and a byte is 8 bits... but there's more
- Conversion
    - 1 byte ~ 8 bits 
    - 1 kilobyte ~ 1000 bytes 
    - 1 megabyte ~ 1000 kilobytes
    - 1 gigabyte ~ 1000 megabytes
    - ...reference your homework for more!

// a bit is just a 0 or 1. And our computer holds memory in the form of 0 or 1
// QUESTION: How many bits are in 1 gigabyte? How many 0/1s are there?
// ANSWER: 1 gigabyte = 1000 megabytes = 1million kilobytes = 1 billion bytes (1m kilo x 1000 bytes) = 8billion bits
