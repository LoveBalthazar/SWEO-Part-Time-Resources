Things to focus on while studying:

- All of the questions/answers folders in 4-day.
- Converting binary, hexadecimal, and decimal numbers to each other, including to ASCII ( for example: String.fromCharCode(parseInt(binary, 2))) (project from 4-day and project from today are great for this practice).
- For every function you write today, please figure out the time and space complexity before you move on!
- Arrays and Array methods complexities.
- Characteristics of stacks
- truth tables
- remember you can use === to compare hex and binary and decimal numbers
