# M2W3D2


## Code-it-out
- What is the big O and time complexity?
- Problem 0 - 5

## Practice Pt. 1: 20 mins

- If your `should run in O(n) time` test fails, call in a TA

## Practice Pt. 1 Discussion

## Practice Pt. 2: 20 mins

## Practice Pt. 2 Discussion

## Practice Pt. 3: 40 mins

- You will ACTUALLY copy/paste your code from pt.2 then add timings
  - Refer to monday readings: `timing benchmakrs` if you're not sure how to apply this
- Apply the logged times to the google spreadsheet to graph it
  - Refer to monday readings: `timing benchmakrs` if you're not sure how to apply this
- You'll each present your findings and tell me, based on your graph, what time\
  complexity you think we see here.
  - If you need help Google sheet instructions are in the homework/Google

## If time is left
- Look through some past weeks functions, can you define their time complexity?
  - If not, ask a TA

## Early Homework Start!
