//given these sorting algorithms, match them up with the correct statement: [bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, quick sort, merge sort]

//1) go through each one on the right unsorted side and inserts it correctly on the sorted left hand side
    //your answer: insertion sort

//2) recursively divide and conquer by dividing the array in half, then sorting each half and combining them again together
    //your answer: merge sort

//3) bubbles up and swaps current value if it is greater than its neighbor to the right
    //your answer: bubble sort

//4) find the smallest one on the right unsorted side and adds it to the end of the sorted side
    //your answer: selection sort

//5) recursively divide and conquer utilizing a pivot, left, and right value where the values less than pivot goes to the left and value greater than pivot goes to the right
    //your answer: quick sort
