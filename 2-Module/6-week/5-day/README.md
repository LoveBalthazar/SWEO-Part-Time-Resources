- 1) `bug prevention`: Test one `thing` after you code it (i.e. one neighbor at a time): 
    - take it `step by step`! don't eat the whole cake! 
    - expect vs. actual --> Before running code, What do I expect to happen, what is the actual result.
- 2) `bug isolation`: if you do run into a bug: 
    - isolate it, go `top to bottom and console log` (or debugger) your variables one at a time!!!

- 3) if we are doing something where we are adding to an a datatype like an array, queue, set, etc. PLEASE console.log the queue, array, set, etc. afterwards to check if it's actually the data that we've added.

## Code-it-out
- `sort-which-sort.js`
- `set-review.js`


## Solo BFS W/ Matrix Project
- part 0: Go over the BFS Matrix problem prompt with everyone
- part 1: In 20 minutes, we will go around and check if everyone was able to start  their `findNeighbor` function on the right foot. (this one is fundamentally as everything will build from this - you'll see something similar on your assessment)
- part 2: before working on the `bfsTraversal` project, review the BFT Plan. Then before we code each step, write our plan first!!!
	//if you need help w/ the plan let us know!! aa-open is also fine to use since it's an available resource if you need to reference.
	//after 30 minutes, if we will go around and check up on everyone to make sure everythings good


## Practice Assessment
- 1) `bug prevention`: Test one `thing` after you code it (i.e. one neighbor at a time): 
    - take it `step by step`! don't eat the whole cake! 
    - expect vs. actual --> Before running code, What do I expect to happen, what is the actual result.
- 2) `bug isolation`: if you do run into a bug: 
    - isolate it, go `top to bottom and console log` (or debugger) your variables one at a time!!!


## Lunch (12pm PST, 3pm EST) - 30m

## PA Walkthrough

## Review For Assessment!
- Go over `assessment-breakdown.md` and make sure we hit those objectives and know them
- Work on coding projects/PA:
  - Practice Assessment (really good)
  - today's project `Breadth-First Search Path with Matrix Practice` (really good)
  - Island project (good for fundamentals)
