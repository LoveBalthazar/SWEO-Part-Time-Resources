# Graph Terminology

- **`Vertex`**: A node in a graph (vertex and node can be used interchangeably)

- **`Directed Edge`**: An edge in a graph that goes from one vertex to another (one way connection)

- **`Undirected Edge`**: An edge in a graph that goes from one vertex to another (two way connection) (functionally the same as a bidirectional edge)

- **`Edge Weight`**: The cost of traversing an edge

- **`Cyclic/Acyclic`**: A graph that has at least 1 cycle (loop) is called cyclic. A graph that has no cycles is called acyclic

- **`Adjacency List`**: An object that has a key for each vertex and a value of an array of all the vertices it points to
