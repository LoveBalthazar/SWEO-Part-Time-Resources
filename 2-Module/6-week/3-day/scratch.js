//Intro to graphs

//Again, a graph is a collection of nodes connected by edges
//Unlike trees, graphs don't always have a "root node" as they can have multiple "starting nodes"

//Directed vs Undirected

//Directed - Arrows on the edges (One way relationship)
//Undirected - No arrows on the edges (Two way relationship)

//Cylic - A graph w cycles
//Acylic - A graph no cycles

//Weighted - Edges can have weights. (usually, heavier weight = slower traversal, lighter = faster)
//Unweighted - Every edge has the same weight (normally a weight of 1);
