# W12D3 - Wed

## Code-it-out
- `adjList.js`

## Graph Exercises
- **first problem** `graph Breadth First Traversal` is very very very very important to get down
  -  as everything else pretty much builds on this, 
  -  and we can solve most problems today through understanding this
- `Reference the homework`, 
  - the plans provided there will help us understand the traversals 


- `Avoid the snowball effect, ask QUESTIONS!!!!!!!:` 
  - we learn by asking questions and going through the process of solving the problem, `NOT watching me do a walkthrough`
    - sometimes walkthroughs are a lazy way of saying `here's the solution` rather than us trying to help cater to your exact needs and help work through the process.
  - We `won't be releasing the solutions or doing walkthroughs` until the end of class in order to give every pair the equal opportunity to learn. `therefore it's important we ask questions when we are stuck!!!!`
  
- Some problems are similar in nature but purpose different tasks. 
  - When moving on to the next question, `AVOID Copying and Pasting!!!`.
  - Remember that we `learn from pulling the information from within us` not looking at our answers.

- Help each other!! 
  - If we can teach it, then we know it. 
  - So if our pair is a bit behind, provide guidance and allow each other to have the opportunity to grow and learn
