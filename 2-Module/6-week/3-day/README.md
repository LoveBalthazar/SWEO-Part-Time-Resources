# W12D3 - Wed

## Code-it-out
- `adjList.js`

## Graph Exercises
- `Reference the homework`, the plans provided there will help us understand the traversals
- Some problems are similar in nature but purpose different tasks. 
  - When moving on to the next question, `AVOID LOOKING AT PREVIOUS SOLUTION`.
  - Remember that we `learn from pulling the information from within us` not looking at our answers.
- `Avoid the snowball effect:` We `won't be releasing the solutions or doing walkthroughs` until the end in order to give every pair the equal opportunity to learn. `therefore it's important we ask questions when we are stuck!!!!`
