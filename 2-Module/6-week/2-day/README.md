# W12D2 - Tuesday


## Sort Coding Practice - Merge Sort
- `Merge Sort`
  - Recursive divide and conquer approach where we:
    - Split unsorted array in half (divide)
    - Sort the halves recursively (conquer)
    - Merge the newly sorted halves (`merge` helper)

## Code-it-out JS Sort
- try `built-in-sort.js`


## Solo Project Time - 1hr 30m
- Custom Sorting Project


## Remainder of time focus on Homework
- Get an early start on the homework as this will be the core portion of your assessment. 
- Basically this is the coding portion and it's worth 12 points and is part 2 (the waaay harder part) of one of the hardest assessment at AA.
- This is the final week of intro to DSA, so make sure we study hard to not come back here!
