## Review Solving Graph Problems reading
- go to `Homework for Wednesday` on AA Open and open the reading [Solving Graph Problems](https://open.appacademy.io/learn/js-py---pt-apr-2022-online/week-12---sorts-and-graphs/solving-graph-problems)
- This will provide tips and strategies for solving graph problems. VERY Helpful for something like our assessment or the projects today!

## Code-it-out
- `bft-traverse-plan.js`
- `dft-traverse-plan.js`
- `matrix-arr-review.js`


## Project Time `Solving Problems With Graphs` (not social graph)
- the Social Graph project will be optional, we're going to focus more on the `island graph practice`
  - the `island problem` is the type of problems you will see more on `interviews` and `YOUR ASSESSMENT`

- If we're stuck, remember to take it step by step, don't try to eat the whole pie. Ask ourselves questions like `how can we find the neighbors of this node here`

- We'll preview the practice assessment so we can get a foothold of what we'll need to focus our studies on for friday + weekend.
- `work on the CODING PORTION` for right now
