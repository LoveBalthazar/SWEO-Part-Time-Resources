- understand the basics of javascript's built in `sort` function and how the comparison callback function works.
- Different sorting algorithms
  - Bubble
  - Insertion
  - Selection
  - Quicksort
  - Mergesort
- Difference between binary tree and binary search tree
- Graph concepts, terminologies, and traversals like BFT, DFT, and which traversal will yield us the shortest path.

- Coding Portion
  - Be able to work with a 2d matrix that represents the graph 
  - Be able to `read mocha spec files for more context`
  - build a neighbor finder, graph traversal, and apply it to solve a problem.
  - understand the 3 principle of solving graphs
    - `Identify graph type`: and define the type of graph
    - `getNeighbors function`: how to implement this to get the neighbors of a given node from a graph
    - `traverse graph`: BFT/DFT and do the thing.
  - recommended projects
    - `solving graph problems - island size`
    - `practice assessment`
    - basic `breadth /depth first traversal`
  - `remember, take it step by step, break the problem into small goals that are workable!!!`
