- Understand the basics of javascript's built in `sort` function and how the comparison callback function works
- Different sorting algorithms
  - Bubble
  - Insertion
  - Selection
  - Quicksort
  - Mergesort
- Difference between binary tree and binary search tree
- Graph concepts, terminologies, and traversals like BFT, DFT, and which traversal will yield us the shortest path.

- Coding Portion
  - Be able to work with a 2d matrix that represents the graph 
  - Be able to `read mocha spec files for more context`
  - Build a neighbor finder, graph traversal, and apply it to solve a problem
  - Understand the 3 principle of solving graphs
    - `Identify graph type`: and define the type of graph
    - `getNeighbors function`: how to implement this to get the neighbors of a given node from a graph
    - `Traverse graph`: BFT/DFT and do the thing.
  - Recommended projects
