## Warmup Problem (30m)

Implement a queue using a linked list instead of an array. Adding and removing elements from the queue should have constant time complexity O(1).

- Node class
  - val property
  - next property
- Queue class
  - head property
  - tail property
  - length property
  - enqueue method
  - dequeue method
  - find method (will traverse the list and return the node containing the search value)
  - size method (will return how many nodes are in the queue)

Make sure to run some tests with node for this implementation to make sure all
of these methods are working correctly!
