## Project Linked-List Pair Programming
- Link List will be a big part of this week's assessment!
- Pair Programming Etiquette:
  - Use I and We
  - Let other person finish speaking (we shouldn't cut in)
  - Focus on the code!! (nothing like politics, etc.)
  - Respect one another and treat one another like how we want to be treated (put ourselves in their shoes)

- If you're stuck for 5 minutes. Mandatory to ask question. You can get a strike for not doing this.
- If you're struggling with any concepts or need more breakdown, let us know! 
  - Einstein: doesn't matter if we think our question is stupid, what matters is we learn and get the answer we need from the question. 


## Homework IMPORTANT
- Go over today's homework, fairly short
- IMPORTANT: Review / do Homework for Wednesday (hashmap homework) as it will be the focus of tomorrow's project.
