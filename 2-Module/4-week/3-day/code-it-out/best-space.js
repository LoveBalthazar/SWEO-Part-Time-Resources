// which of the following datastructures have a Big O space compleixty of O(1) ?
// choices: arrays, stack, queues, singly ll, doubly ll, hashmap (POJOs), or none.
// hint: (hint: what is the growth curve of the space compared to the growth of `n` number of elements. Take a look at the Big-O Cheatsheet)


//your answer: all of those datastructures have a worst space complexity of O(n).
