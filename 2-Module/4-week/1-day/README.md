# W10D1 - Monday

## Assessment (1h50m)
- 1 hr 50m
  
- 9 MC; 6 Specs; 
  - Passing score: 12/15

- You can always use the node to test code, reference homework on AA-Open for content, BUT NOT NOTES!

- Remember that these are `also available resources`:
  - practice assessment
  - any code you've written on `coding problems` like `code-it-outs` that you've done.
  - Formative quizzes on AA open
  - Homework and readings on AA open
  - MDN

- Make sure we **Read the question carefully** (i.e. `dynamic arrays` vs `array`)

- Remember, looking things up can slow you down. Try with your own knowledge first, there's enough time for everything

- Don't hesitate to ask questions if something is confusing or we require clarity! We cannot help you code, but we can explain the question and point you to available resources.

### Coding Portion Advice
- read the directions, check out the recommendation they provide 

- If we're unable to get started on a question after 10 minutes, don't stare down the code, move on to the next question and come back later.  
  - If you're spending too much time **STARRING DOWN YOUR CODE**, or you're having anxiety, panicking, etc. then <span style="color:#cd1d1d;">ask us a question on live channel</span> to help clarify the prompt even if you think you understood it.
