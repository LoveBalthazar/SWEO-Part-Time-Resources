# W10D1 - Monday

## Assessment (1h50m)
- 1 hr 50m
  
- 9 MC; 6 Specs; 
  - Passing score: 12/15

- You can always use the node to test code, all of aa-open (besides previous assessment), MDN, BUT NOT NOTES!

- Remember that these are `also available resources`:
  - practice assessment
  - any code you've written on `coding problems` like `code-it-outs` that you've done.
  - Formative quizzes on AA open
  - Homework and readings on AA open
  - MDN

- Make sure we **Read the question carefully** (i.e. `dynamic arrays` vs `array`)

- Remember, looking things up can slow you down. Try with your own knowledge first, there's enough time for everything

- Don't hesitate to ask questions if something is confusing or we require clarity! We cannot help you code, but we can explain the question and point you to available resources.

### Coding Portion Advice
- read the directions, check out the recommendation they provide 
- It's a lot more simple than you think. If you feel like you're doing too much, read the question again (check hints, inputs and outputs), and try a different way (redo the problem)


## Early Homework Start!
- Active Learning Example
- Now that you've done a bit of the reading, go through it again, and try to code out the link-list section by section from memory!
