## Project Solo
### Hashmap
- **Pojos:** 
  - You've worked with this before! They're Pojos!
  - in other languages they might be called hashmaps & dictionaries.
-  **Use Case:** 
   -  Used to implement everything from JavaScript objects and sets to performance-boosting caches
-  **Constant Big-O:** 
   -  providing key/value storage with constant big-O time complexity for insertion, deletion, access and search.
-  **HashTables Makeup**: 
   -  hash tables use **hash functions** and an underlying **array structure** to achieve **flexible data storage** with nearly all the efficiency of an array.
-  **Collision**: 
   -  2 different keys can have the same hash output (hash collision), i.e.
       - Hash("ABC100") = `400`
       - Hash("XYZ200") = `400`
