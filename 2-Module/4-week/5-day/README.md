## Hash Table Implementations

## Review

- Linked lists, hash tables, queues, arrays
- Doubly vs. Singly linked list operations and time complexity
- Understanding Hash Collision
  - i.e. what happens when 2 different keys, after going through a hash function/modulo, have the same hash output?
- Time complexity (average and worst) of hash table operations, linked lists operations,
  - i.e. operations like remove, insert, lookup, etc.

- Coding Portion: Analyze and Refactor
  - Polya's Plan
    - Understand the prompt. Read the code and see what it is doing
    - Make a plan, add comments to reflect what the code should do
    - Execute
  - Given the wrong or slow usage of a data structure for the code, determine which other data structure(s) is better fit for the job
	- Apply that data structure (changing it from the old to the new)
	- Refactor the code to make it work w/ new data structure (apply the new data structure's methods over the old ones)
    - Data structures that we should have familiarity with (don't have to build it, but know how to use it)
    - Queues (implemented through linked list)
    - Sets
  	- Arrays
  	- Linked Lists
