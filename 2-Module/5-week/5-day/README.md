## White-Boarding Strategies! ~ 45m
- White-Boarding Tips and Tricks
- White-Boarding Tips Video
- Bonus: White-Boarding Exercises

## Read the Trees and Traversal Readings Again! ~1hr
- `IMPORTANT`: Sharing Screen + Facecam On. 
- Do `Homework for Tuesday - all tree readings`
  - `Binary Tree Objectives`
  - `Intro to trees`
  - `Tree Traversal`
  - `Binary Search Trees`
- since we are familiar with the material (trees) after practicing it all week, going back to the readings will allow us to pick up a broader understanding of important concepts. 
  - (You will get many big lightbulbs momements - "ahhh that makes sense now")
- Once done, review `Binary Search Tree Practice Part 1-4`

## Practice Assessment
- (bug) on PA, the question `What order would a depth-first traversal print the nodes in this tree?` has `two correct answers`, but it will only accept one.

- Build the function from scratch (on exam, you'll be given a bugged function, you can either restart w/ your own code or debug the problem)

- Debugging Tips to ISOLATE the BUG if we run into one:
  - `mocha -b`: 
    - check error message to see what the output was vs. correct answer.
    - check test specs file for more examples
  - Understand problem: (Remember, avoid running big examples!! Start small first)
    - Run node on the SMALL example
    - draw out the SMALL tree through the example (code, diagram, paint, drawing, etc.)
  - Run Debugger: uncomment SMALL EXAMPLE for step by step analysis 
    - remember to add variables you want to watch. i.e. `currentNode`, `currentNode.left`, etc.
  - Check for `conceptual lapses in the code`, for example, `are the methods correct for the datastructure provided`

- Take it one step at time. Use smaller examples first (empty node, then root node, then root node with 1 child, 2 child, etc...)

## Lunch (12pm PST, 3pm EST) - 30m

## PA Walkthrough

## Review + Homework!
- Review for assessment (projects, readings, formative quizzes, PAs, etc.)
- Start `intro to sorting` reading

## Homework
- Rest of `Sorting readings` will be assigned as homework over the break
  - Will have one reading attached w/ a Tree exercise each day to make sure our skills are not going to rust! 
  - remember, long breaks in coding can be a double edge sword. This is still a bootcamp at the end of the day and `bootcamps are intense, hard, and not easy`
