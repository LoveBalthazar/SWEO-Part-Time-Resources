# W11D2 - Tuesday

## Flow
- first work on `binary-search.js`
- `binary-tree-draw.js`

- `bst-insert.js`
- BST Project `insert` functionality (can use while loop or recursion)

- `bst-search.js`
- BST Project `search` functionality (can use while loop or recursion)

## Binary Search Tree Project
- FIRST DRAW OUT THE TREE. We need to visualize it and take it step by step.
- Take it one step at time. Use smaller examples first (empty node, then root node, then root node with 1 child, 2 child, etc...)
- Ask questions!
