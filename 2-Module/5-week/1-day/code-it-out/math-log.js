//Log is just the inverse of exponent: We take the result and keep dividing by the base each time until we get to 1 (our one answer).


//1) given a logarithmic base 2 of 16 --> log2(16). How many STEPS / OPERATIONS did it take to get to 1 (by dividing 16 by 2 each time until 1)?

//WRITE YOUR WORK and ANSWER HERE:
//1) 16 / 2 = 8 ...
//2) ...



//2) given an array of 4503599627370496 elements, How many STEPS / OPERATIONS will it take to get to 1 by dividing the array into 2 each time --> log2(4503599627370496)?

// log2( 1 )    = 0
// log2( 2 )    = 1
// log2( 4 )    = 2
// log2( 8 )    = 3
// log2( 16 )   = 4
// log2( 32 )   = 5
// log2( 64 )   = 6
// log2( 128 )  = 7
// log2( 256 )  = 8
// log2( 512 )  = 9
// log2( 1024 ) = 10
// ...
// log2( 4503599627370496 ) = ???
