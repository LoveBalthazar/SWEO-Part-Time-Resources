# W11D1 - Monday

## Assessment (1h30m)
- 1 hr 30m
  
- 5 MC; 11 Specs; 
  - Passing score: 12/16

- Remember that these are `also available resources`:
  - practice assessment
  - any code you've written on `coding problems` like `code-it-outs` that you've done.
  - Formative quizzes on AA open
  - Homework and readings on AA open
  - MDN

- Don't hesitate to ask questions if something is confusing or we require clarity! We cannot help you code, but we can explain the question and point you to available resources.

### Coding Portion Advice
- Always have a reference to the original code.

- **understand the problem:** 
  - by reading the code, methods, mocha output, etc. (don't stare down the prompt)
  - mocha -b is a great way to take it one problem at at time.

- **read and analyze each method:**
  - determine which datastructure it is using & the time complexity of each the operations
  - ADD COMMENTS!!! i.e. "this operation .unshift is O(n), if we use a queue and use dequeue, it would be O(1)"
  - Would using a different one (datastructure tthat they suggested) improve the time?

- **change the datastructure & refactor** (set or ll-queue). 
  - Then read each function again and make sure each line is compatible with the new datastructure (refactor if necessary)
  - When you apply the new method, MAKE SURE to look on MDN and that the logic makes sense. `becareful, just changing a method name doesn't mean everything works.`

## Logarithm and Binary Search
- try `linear-search.js` first in the `code-it-out` folder
- 30 minutes to do the readings:
  - Logarithms
  - Binary Search
- Review Discussion
- Try Problem:
  - `binary search practice`
- Discussion / Walkthrough
