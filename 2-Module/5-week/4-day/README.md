# W11D4 - Thurs

## Continue Project
- Wrap up `focus on BFS and DFS implementation!!` 
- If you finished, delete dfs/bfs, repeat and confirm that you know how to code it. (i.e. maybe our pair was the one navigating, we also want to make sure we know how to and CAN do it ourselves)

## Code-it-out
- without referencing any solutions or code, work on `dfs-stack.js`

## Work on Long Tree Project
- FIRST DRAW OUT THE TREE. We need to visualize it and take it step by step.
- Take it one step at time. Use smaller examples first (empty node, then root node, then root node with 1 child, 2 child, etc...)
- Ask questions!

- Remember that staring and `only analyzing` the solution ISN'T going to help us solve it. We must try it ourselves without reference even if we already saw the solution. This confirms that we can do it.
  - I.e. if the we received a question on the exam right now asking us to implement the BST `.search` method, without reference to the solution, could we do it?
