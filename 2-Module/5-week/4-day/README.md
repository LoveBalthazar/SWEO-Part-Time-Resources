## Warmup Problem 30m

Construct a binary search tree. Avoid using the code you wrote yesterday, the
point of this exercise is not for you to necessarily complete everything, it is
to drill the process.

It should have:

- A node class
- A Binary Search Tree Class
- An insert method: to correctly insert a value into the tree.
- A search method: to determine if a value is included in the tree.
- A traversal method: to visit every node in the tree, you may choose any
  traversal order, breadth or depth search.

## Long Practice (Paired)

We will leave rooms open for the entirety of class time. After an hour I will
head out the main room to answer any questions that you and your pair may want
more input on outside of asking breakout room questions. This will be optional,
if you are in a good workflow and are making progress feel free to keep up the
work!
