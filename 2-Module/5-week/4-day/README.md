- Binary search concepts (arrays + trees)
- Trees: Binary + Binary Search
- Different tree traversals: BFS, DFS (using queue, stack, inorder, preorder, postorder), etc.
  - i.e. Given a tree, can you provide the output if asked for pre-order, etc?
- Big O and Time complexity of binary tree operations
- Go over terms:

- Coding Portion: Analyze and Debug
  - Given almost working code, get it to work (debug).
  - Understand the different traversals: DFS, BFS, etc.
  - Be able to debug the code to work properly w/ the methods used correctly for the given data structure
