- Binary search concepts (arrays + trees)
- Trees: Binary + Binary Search
- Different tree traversals: BFS, DFS (using queue, stack, inorder, preorder, postorder), etc.
  - i.e. Given a tree, can you provide the output if asked for pre-order, etc?
- Big O and Time complexity of binary tree operations
- Go over terms:
  - Node: An element in a graph
  - Edges: The connections between nodes, also called a pointer.
  - Root: The ultimate parent, the node of a tree that can access all other nodes
    through edges. The root cannot have a parent.
  - Parent/Child: A Parent node points to a child node.
  - Neighbors: The connections to a given node.
  - Subtree: A Tree whose root node is a child of another node in the tree.
  - Internal Node: A node that has children and has a parent, also called a branch
    node.
  - Leaf: A node that does not have any children. An outer node.
  - Path: A series of nodes that can be traversed through edges.
  - Level: The number of edges between a node and the root node.
  - Height: The number of edges between the root node and the bottom-most node.
- Projects
  - Practice Assessment
  - Binary Search Tree Practice
  - Binary Trees Long Practice (Min/Max BST - countNodes)   
- Coding Portion: Analyze and Debug
  - Given almost working code, get it to work (debug).
  - Understand the different traversals: DFS, BFS, etc.
  - Be able to debug the code to work properly w/ the methods used correctly for the given data structure
