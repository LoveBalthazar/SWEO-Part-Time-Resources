## Project Time

We are not introducing any new topics today, so we will be getting right into the project. You will have 2 hours to work on this project, followed by a full walkthrough with a chance to ask any questions you might have. Please use this opportunity to clear up anything that you don't understand!

[Binary Trees Long Practice](https://open.appacademy.io/learn/js-py---pt-may-2022-online/week-11---binary-search-and-trees/binary-trees-long-practice)

- If there is time after the project and walkthrough, Make sure you've done the extra Q&A problems from yesterdays lecture folder, it's important you can guess the order things will be printed when using pre-in-post order traversal!
- Also, Go back and try to redo the other project from this week without looking at your solution. Time yourself and try to do it quickly. 
- Test yourself on your tree terminology from the 2-day lecture folder. 
- If you're feeling comfortable with this weeks material, please take a look at Saturdays material and do the readings on sorts. That is what we will be working on next week, and they can be a little tricky. Start researching them now to get a head start!
