//*************Preorder**************
//given this tree, use Preorder traversal to log the data in that order(don't code, just provide output throw analysis)?
//hint: Preorder traversal is good for visiting the data first as we traverse the node
//Your answer: 


//*************Inorder**************
//given this tree, use inorder traversal to log the data in that order
//hint: inorder traversal is good for visiting the nodes data in a way that gives an inherent order
//Your answer: 


//*************Postorder**************
//given this tree, use Postorder traversal to log the data in that order
//hint: Postorder traversal is good for visiting left subtree first, the right, then the root.
//Your answer:
