# W11D3 - Wednesday

## Continue Project
- Continue the project, try to finish up `.insertion` and `.search `
- If we're stuck, it's mandatory to ask questions!!!

## Flow
- `order-traversal.js` in the code-it-out folder
- BST Project - `preorder`, `inorder` , `postorder`
- `dfs-bfs.js` in the code-it-out folder
- BST Project - `DFS` and `BFS`

## Finish Up Binary Search Tree Project
- FIRST DRAW OUT THE TREE. We need to visualize it and take it step by step.
- Take it one step at time. Use smaller examples first (empty node, then root node, then root node with 1 child, 2 child, etc...)
- Ask questions!

- Remember that staring and `only analyzing` the solution ISN'T going to help us solve it. We must try it ourselves without reference even if we already saw the solution. This confirms that we can do it.
  - I.e. if the we received a question on the exam right now asking us to implement the BST `.search` method, without reference to the solution, could we do it?
