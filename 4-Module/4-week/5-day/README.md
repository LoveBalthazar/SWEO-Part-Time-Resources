# W22D4 - Saturday

## Study Review (25m)
- open the `assessment-breakdown.md` and get a feel for which section you'll need practice the most
- Starting reading the `practice-assessment`

## Code-it-out
- try `associations.js`
- try `eager-lazy.js`

## Asking Technical/Conceptual Questions Through Text
- As a SWE, one of the most important skills to hone is being able to ask a `good` question over text, which will allow others to participate and help as well
- If we're stuck for more than 10 minutes, mandatory to ask for help

- format:
  - `screenshot` (if relevant, highly recommend)
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/SifGcqe.png)
  - `context` about the issue: 
    - "Help in room x please, I got this error, after establishing my associations on model x and y. I tried deleting the dev.db, and restarting but it still gave me z error."

## Practice Assessment
- `IMPORTANT`: for the `Express and Sequelize Search Filter/ Pagination` section
	- also run: `npm install dotenv-cli` since package.json doesn't have it so your dotenv commands won't work

- Double check syntax errors, models = singular, tables = plural

- If we run into an error, backtrack a bit and ask `what were the last few changes I've done that could cause this problem`


- if undo seed or undo migration doesn't work, try deleting dev.db and migrating again (if that doesn't work, most likely a syntax issue)


## Lunch

## Practice Assessment Continue

## Work on Project, Study 
- Take a look at the bottom of `assessment-breakdown.md` for things to focus and prioritize
