## Express

- What is Express?
  - Backend javascript framework. used to develop servers, and abstracts away a lot of boilerplate
- How do you start using Express as your backend framework in
  your projects?
  - Install the Express node module: 
  - `npm install express`
  - Import the Express node module as an unnamed export in your
    JavaScript file: 
    - `const express = require('expressâ€™)`
  - Invoke the unnamed export as a function, also called your
    Express application: 
    `const app = express()`
  - Make the Express application listen for requests on a
    specified port number. 
    `express.listen(port, (port) => console.log('listening on ${port}'))`
- What are reasons why you would choose Express as your backend
  framework?
  - Express is an unopinionated framework, which means it can
    be easily customized, but still eliminates some boilerplate
    code or code that needs to constantly be repeated and can
    be condensed.
  - One of the biggest advantages of choosing Express as your
    backend framework is that it is a JavaScript framework. This
    means that you can develop your frontend code AND your
    backend code in JavaScript instead of coding in two different
    languages for your full-stack application.
  
- How do you interact with an Express server?
  - Same way as how you interact with all servers, by making a
    request, sending it to the server, and seeing what you get
    back as the response.
