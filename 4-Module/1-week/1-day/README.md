# W18D1 - Monday

## Assessment (1h45m)
- Breakdown:
  - time: 1hr45m
  - 9 MC x 1pt = 9pts 
  - 6 specs x 2pt = 12pts
  - Passing Score: 16 / 21

- Take our time with the MC
- `utilize console.log to your advantage!!! Follow the data we're working with` 

- Remember that these are `also available resources`:
  - practice assessment
  - any code you've written on `coding problems` like `code-it-outs` that you've done.
  - Formative quizzes on AA open
  - Homework and readings on AA open
  - MDN
  - `vsCode node` to run and execute code

- Don't hesitate to ask questions if something is confusing or we require clarity! We cannot help you code, but we can explain the question and point you to available resources.

- `Problem 5 hint:` 
  - Go into the full `documentation` and see if we can find what the exam means by `sub-breed` (i.e. we want all the sub-breeds of hound)
  - `Follow the data:` what datatype are we working with? Objects, arrays? etc.
    - We can always test the get request and `see what JSON data` it is sending back by entering the `API URL` into the `browser`.
