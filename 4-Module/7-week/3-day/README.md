# Week 25 Day 3

## Tips
- Whenever we do the migrations, models, and seed data --> `ABC = Always Be referencing the DB Diagram`
- Test often!! `DO NOT continue on without testing your card`
- Re-emphasize to Reference the 4 Videos in week 25:
  - `How to use API Docs to Code API Endpoint`
    - good if we want to revisit migration, model, seed, and then building out a full route
  - `Review on How to Manipulate POJOs` 
    - If you have questions about how to format, move data around, and manipulate your data from the database 
- make daily commits, quota of 5-10
  - `commit after testing and everything works!!!`
