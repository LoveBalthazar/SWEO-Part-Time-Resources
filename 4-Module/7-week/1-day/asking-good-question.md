## Asking Technical/Conceptual Questions Through Text
- As a SWE, one of the most important skills to hone is being able to ask a `good` question over text, which will allow others to participate and help as well

### `Good question components`: 
- `showed effort`: at trying to solve the problem, breaking it down, etc.
  - i.e. "I attempted to undo the seeder, undo the migration, and even dropped my database and the issue is still persisting"
- `context to the problem`: providing as much relevant information ... 
  - images,  code, and any other data about the issue you're having

### `RULES`
- `rule 1 - text question`: we will now shift our questions through text for the project as required by curriculum.
  - if we read your question and it's something that cannot be solved through text, then we will join the zoom to take a look
- `rule 2 - personal question`: exceptions if it's something that needs to be conveyed over voice, will allow
    - i.e. meetings, personal discussion, feeling embarrassed about a question(we would rather have you ask a question then no question), technical issues outside of
	- format: "Personal Question in Room X"
	- We'll be lenient when first starting, but will get more strict
- `rule 3 - feel free to participate`: feel free to chime in, reply to the thread, and help your fellow peers out in the thread if you know how to resolve the issue and want to flex those muscles!
