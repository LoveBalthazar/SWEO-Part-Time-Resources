# W21D1 - Monday

## Assessment (1hr55m)
- Breakdown:
  - time: 1hr55m
  - 10MC = 10pts 
  - 14specs = 14pts
  - Passing Score: 18 / 24

## Tips

- `transient` definition means `temporary / lasting for a short time`.

- Use `single quotes`!!!
```sql
INSERT INTO holidays (name, month) VALUES
    ('Father''s Day', 'June'),
    ( 'Aliens''s Day', null);
```
- You can do the queries in any order (i.e. file 5 then file 3). So if we're stuck, just move to the next one.

## Resources 
- Ask questions if you don't understand something. We cannot give you the answer, but we can clarify the question.

- Remember that these are `also available resources`:
  - `sqlite.org` docs
  - `aa-readings` docs
  - `w3 sql` docs
  - `Practice Assessment`
  - any code you've written on `coding problems` like `code-it-outs` that you've done.
  - Formative quizzes on AA open
  - Homework and readings on AA open
  - MDN
  - `vsCode node` to run and execute code


- Question freebee (since we didn't have time to cover this material):
  - `What should you use to count the number of records returned in a SELECT query?`
    - Answer is: `An aggregate`
