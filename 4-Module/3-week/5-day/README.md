# W21D5 - Saturday

## Review: 
- Practice: Sequelize SELECT Queries
- Long Practice: Sequelize Foundation (Phases 1-4)
  - covers: `migration files`, `models`, `seeders`, and `model validation/database constraints` which will be the **biggest part of your exam**.

## Practice: Sequelize INSERT Data (THURSDAY)
- Homework and Sequelize docs for reference

## Practice: Sequelize UPDATE and DELETE Singular Records (THURSDAY)
- Homework and Sequelize docs for reference

## Practice Assessment: Coding Portion Phase 1
- Express and Sequelize Phase 1

- This phase on the PA is long and a bit confusing:
  - don't worry, the exam won't be this long or hacky or wacky
  - work on these test specs:
    - `npm test test/00-flightNumber-spec.js`
    - `npm test test/01-model-spec.js`
    - `npm test test/02-inService-spec.js`
    - `npm test test/03-homeBase-spec.js`
    - `npm test test/04-maxNumPassengers-spec.js`
    - `npm test test/05-currentNumPassengers-spec.js`
    - `npm test test/10-createdAt-spec.js`
    - `npm test test/11-updatedAt-spec.js`
  - (skip test 6, 7, 8, 9, you can come back to it later if you don't get to it on time)
  - don't worry about the 3 specs failing
	- `homeBase` and `cruisingAltitudeFt` combination cannot be repeated
