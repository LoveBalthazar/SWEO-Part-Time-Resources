// Scrum: 

// NOT AN ACRONYM 

// About roles not about authority

// Main Roles:

// Product Owner: knows what the end goal of the application should look like and direct the rest of the team

// Scrum Master: LEAD the team not manage the team

// Development Team: these people actaully code out and test the application

// 5-10 people is common


// GIT:

// git branch : shows you all your branches and which branch you are currently on

// git checkout <branch name>: create a new branch and move you to that branch OR move you to that branch 
// (note!!! if creating a new branch, the current branch that you're on is the branch that you will inherit code from -> try to inherit from dev)

// git pull: get code from the main source

// git push: adding code to be merged 

// To MERGE to dev:

// git status
// git checkout dev
// git merge feature-name
// git push origin dev
