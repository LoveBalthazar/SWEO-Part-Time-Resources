# Mod 4 Week 5 Day 2

## The three major roles in the Scrum framework: the product owner, the scrum master, and the development team.
- in this project, Your Cohort Instructor and TA will be the product owner, and the scrum master, you will be the Devlopment team.

## The Sprint and Sprint Planning
- Within the Scrum framework, sprints are timeboxed segments that have specific goals and produce tangible results. The development team, scrum master, and product owner are able to reflect on the results of the sprint and make plans for what should be implemented in the next iteration.

## Goals for this project
- Create a Database per project owner specs
- Create an API per project owner specs
- Host your Backend on a live render.com implementation


## Daily Standup (Scrum) Meetings
### Throughout the project, you will participate in daily standup, or scrum, meetings. These will happen every morning with your Project Manager. During these meetings you should be prepared to discuss four major topics:

- What has been accomplished since the previous standup?
- What will you do from now until the next standup?
- Is there anything that needs to be reviewed by your Project Manager?
- Are there any current or anticipated blockers preventing your progress?


## Polymorphism Recall
- The dictionary definition of polymorphism is "having several shapes or forms" In object-oriented programming, polymorphism refers to processing various data types and classes through a single, uniform interface. The two most common types of polymorphism are "overloading" and "overriding".

### Overloading
- Having multiple functions of the same name that take different parameters. Depending on parameters inputed the correct function will be chosen and ran at time of compiling. Is not supported in nodeJs

### Overriding
- Having a child class use its own defined method instead of using its parents class method. This will happen at run time, is generally slower than Overloading. Is supported in nodeJs
