# Welcome to project planning week!


## What is polymorphism and how can we use it with a db schema?

Discussion: Sequelize Polymorphism

[Sequelize polymorphic association docs](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/advanced-association-concepts/polymorphic-associations/)

Practice: Sequelize Polymorphism (30 Minutes)

## What is this "project"?

- Backend application mainly consisting of a database, routes, and user authentication/authorization
- Working solo as a developer, reporting to your project manager (me!)
- There will be test specs, specs in general will be testing your routes to see if you are able to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Projects must be chosen by end of day, your project MUST be approved by me before you begin working on it.
- Every day we have a a daily standup where you and I will talk about:
    - what you worked on in the past day
    - what you will work on today
    - does anything need to be reviewed by me?
    - what are your blockers, if any?


# Projects

Each project will require different MVPS(Minimum viable product)
ALL projects will require USER AUTHENTICATION/AUTHORIZATION
