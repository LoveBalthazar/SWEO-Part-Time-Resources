0. Lots of practice!
1. Practice Assessment

**_Quick Notes_**:

1. We won't be able to go over every problem during lecture periods
   today. This makes it even more important for you to ask for help if you don't
   understand a problem. If you run into any confusion ask for help in the
   questions channel. We are more than happy to pop into your room and help!

2. question format: `I need help in room 1`
