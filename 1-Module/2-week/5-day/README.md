- If you're stuck; If you do look at the solution. Close it after, and do the problems again until you can do it without referencing solution.
  - You'll learn by actively recalling, not by passively looking at the solution.
  - Best way is still to ask us questions when you're stuck!

## Practice Assessment - 1hr

  - Not only will it help you on assessment
