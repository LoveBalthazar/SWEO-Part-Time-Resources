# Week 2 Day 2

Today, we'll spend some time at the beginning of class discussing the methods 
that came up in the homework. We'll spend some time working through [String's split method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split)
as well as [Array's join method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/join).
We'll want to think about why we might need these methods.
* Are strings mutable or immutable?
* What about arrays?
* How can these differences guide our problem solving approaches?

We'll also be taking a look at [Array's split method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split).
We'll take some time to explore the documentation on these methods and see if
we can think of any scenarios where it might be useful. See you in class!
