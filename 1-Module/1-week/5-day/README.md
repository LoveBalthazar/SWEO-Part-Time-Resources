## Pseudocode
- Pseudocode is the process of writing comments in your code
- The comments should be in simple English
    - Pseudocode can use coding terminology, but it should **NOT** be code itself
    - Describe problems or solutions you are thinking about
- Pseudocode is also helpful in a team based setting
    - Instead of making your teammates read your code to understand what it's doing, you can write a description
- Pseudocode is commonly associated with Polya's guide to solving problems


## Polya's
### 1. Understand the Question
- Sometimes easy, sometimes much harder
- Try rephrasing the question to simple words and not using coding terms
- Take into consideration any constraints/edge cases
- Ask questions to clarify the question

### 2. Make a Plan
- Break down the question
- Solve a simpler version of the problem
- Look for patterns
- Work backwords

Computer science is still a science. Apply the scientific method.
Create a hypothesis and test it out.

### 3. Execute the Plan
- Easiest part of Polya's, but can also be hardest
- Takes the understanding of the question and the plan from simple English to code
    - This requires a basis of coding knowledge
- Pseudocode is very beneficial
    - Pseudocode is technically beneficial in all stages of Polya's, but here especially

### 4. Revise the Solution
- Refactoring is a big part of code
- Can you improve the solution?
    - Can you make it more efficient?
    - Can you make it easier to read?
    - Check if there could be any situation where it breaks your solution
