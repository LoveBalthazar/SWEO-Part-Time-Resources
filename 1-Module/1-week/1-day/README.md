## Asking Questions

This is a element of your learning here at App Academy. You will start off by
just reaching out for help without any expectations of question quality from us.
By the time you complete the course here, we will expect that you have learned
how to ask effective questions as if you were in a work place asking help from a
senior engineer.

For now, just post that you need help and your room number in the live-questions
channel.

Please ask questions during lectures. Use the zoom raised hand feature to avoid
talking over me or other students.

## Zoom Etiquette

1. Cameras On, unless you have reached out to an instructor and have gotten an
   ok to be cameras off for the day or have an emergency take place and need to
   quickly turn the camera off and then back on.
2. Mic Off, unless you have raised a hand in zoom and been called on.
3. Be Present, both during lectures and pairing. Dont be playing games on your
   computer, checking social media, or messing with your phone during class
   time.
4. Make sure your zoom name matches your preferred name (slack as well)

## Expressions

If you think of coding as a language, an expression is like a sentence, a
variable is a noun, and a keyword is a verb. A sentence combines nouns, verbs,
and other elements of language to bring across a single point. It takes words
and produces meaning.

An expression is a statement that __evaluates__ to something as opposed to a
value which __is__ something, or a keyword that __does__ something.

```js
5 + 5 // -> 10

"hello" + " " + "world" // -> "hello world"

5 === 5 // -> true

5 !== 4 // -> true

1 < 2 // -> true

2 > 1 // -> true
```

## Numbers

- We can have whole numbers, decimals, and negative numbers
- Order of Operations
  - P.E.M.D.A.S.
- Modulo
  - Returns the remainder of a division expression
- NaN
