## Readline Pt2 Project (45m)

## Build Your Own Readline Project!!

- We challenge everyone to build something using the readline library we learned
  - whether it is a simple text based program of your favorite game or show
  - A card game like poker or a Full blown boardgame like connect four, Quiz games
  - Maybe some thing more practical like a banking system
  - Or a BOT that reads user data and does calculation for you
  - Even a calculator is cool too!

- The options are endless, This is like your first project, `be creative`!

- Optional showcase on saturday where everyone can share and play around with your creation! We Will start a thread for anyone that wants to show off their masterpiece!

- Highly recommend to do this project as it's a great way to start your github porfolio and add things to it.
  - So create a repo
  - then push your project up there today,
  - and start making commits to fill up those gardens over the weekend!

## Other Options: Priority on what to work on

If you finish your custom readline project, you can work on the following:

- Homework / previous lecture on Conceptual Material (Being able to break down event loop, etc.)
- Practice Practice Exam (extra problems from day 3)
- All the warm ups (`code-it-out`) that we did
- Projects (we're not completely finished with recursion so go back and redo some of the recursion projects from last week.)
- Redo the Kahoot!
