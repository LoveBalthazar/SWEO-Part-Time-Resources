## Assessment (1h35m)
- Every multiple choice counts! Doublecheck your answers. You can always use the node to test code, reference homework on AA-Open, BUT NOT NOTES! 

- **VERY IMPORTANT**: run `mocha` before submitting! Any syntax or code failures can result in a zero if `mocha` doesn't work!!

- After you have finished and submitted your assessment, you can verify your submission by clicking `your submission`:

- If you submit like below 5 minutes before assessment ends, we cannot help you. Please start submission process early (preferrably 10 minutes before assessment ends).

### Coding Portion Advice
- If we're stuck, always check the **inputs** and **outputs**, then **write a plan** in english (the what) then implement it (the how) - polya's plan

- If you don't know where to start, ask us a question on live channel to help clarify the prompt even if you think you understood it.

- If we're unable to get started on a question after 10 minutes, don't stare down the code, move on to the next question and come back later.  
  - some coding can be easier than others, I suggest opening all, reading each one and choosing your battle. (small victories will get you momentum!)


## Asynchronicity Introduction
- Message Queue & Event Loop (reading - 10m)
- Intro to Async JS (reading - 10m)
- Timeouts and Intervals (reading - 10m)

## Homework
- Avoid that **SNOWBALL EFFECT**! Start on homework right away and get it done first!
- Assessment will have concepts of the event loop (callstack / message), async JS, and coding problems like setTimeout on it. 
- SetTimeout Lecture homework & SetInterval Lecture homework are especially important as your projects will be based on this.
