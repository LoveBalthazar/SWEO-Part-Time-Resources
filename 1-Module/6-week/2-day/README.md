# W6D1

## Assessment (1h35m)
- Every multiple choice counts! Double-check your answers. You can always use Node to test code, reference homework on a/A Open, BUT NOT NOTES! 

- **VERY IMPORTANT**: run `mocha` before submitting! Any syntax or code failures can result in a zero if `mocha` doesn't work!
  
### Coding Portion Advice
- If we're stuck, always check the **inputs** and **outputs**, then **write a plan** in english (the what) then implement it (the how) - Polya's Plan

- If you don't know where to start, ask us a question in live-questions channel to help clarify the prompt even if you think you understood it.

- If you're unable to get started on a question after 10 minutes, don't stare down the code, move on to the next question and come back later.  
  - some coding can be easier than others, I suggest opening all, reading each one and choosing your battle. (small victories will get you momentum!)
