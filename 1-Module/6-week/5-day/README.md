## Wrap Up Readline Project || Study (1hr)

#### Wrap Up Readline Proj
- Continue and wrap up the readline project as much as possible
- Upload it to github and make it public

#### Study - This Week Objectives
- Async (non-blocking) vs. Sync Code (blocking)
- Event Loop
  - Callstack
  - Message Queue
- Be able to work with async code like setTimeout
- Previous concepts from earlier weeks like closure, scope, recursion, first class objects, etc.
- Be able to solve problems with recursion
  - Understand terminologies like:
    -  base case, recursive case, recursive step
    -  Using recursion to help solve the original problem by...
       -  solving many smaller sub-problems first.
- Understand how to debug problems
- Work with big problems and know how to break them down to smaller ones to tackle


## Optional Showcase of your Cool Readline Project!
- Everyone, please message me the link to your project
- Share screen and walk us through your awesome proj!


## Practice Assessment / Study
- **VERY IMPORTANT**
  - Don't look at solution for FRQs / code, try it, even if we don't know the answer, give the wrong answer first
  - Then after, check the answer, and then we'll have a strong desire to LEARN why that is the right answer and why our answer was wrong. Rather than just copying the right answer.
  - Try this as this is a practice assessment, and there's **NO RISK IN BEING WRONG on a PA** 
- If you finished early, try the code it out folder for quick review!
- **Please have your cameras on, thank you**
