## Reminder
- remember to do your reports!

- Don't ever feel bad or sorry about asking questions
  
- Not asking a question can have a snowball effect! 

- Snowball effect will cause you to fall behind and lose time. 
  
- Time is valuable. Let us save you some time!

#### This Week Objectives
- Async vs. Sync Code
  - Execution of order
  - Examples of async code (we've been working with one all week!)
- Event Loop
  - Callstack
  - Message Queue
- Be able to work with async code like setTimeout
- Previous concepts from earlier weeks like closure, scope, recursion, first class objects, etc.
- Be able to solve problems with recursion
  - Understand terminologies like:
    -  base case, recursive case, recursive step
    -  Using recursion to help solve the original problem by...
       -  solving many smaller sub-problems first.
- Understand how to debug problems
- Work with big problems and know how to break them down to smaller ones to tackle


#### Priority on what to work on
- Practice Assessment
- Homework / Lecture on Conceptual Material (Being able to break down event loop, etc.)
- Practice Practice Assessment (extra problems)
- Projects, Practice Problems, warm ups
- All multiple choices for saturday and previous days like formative quizzes.
  - Don't have to do flashcards unless you want to.
- All the warm ups (`code-it-out`) that we did
