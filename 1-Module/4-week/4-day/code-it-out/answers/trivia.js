// what are the different ways of declaring a variable and which one is function/local scoped?
    // const - block scope - CANNOT be reassigned
    // let - block scope - can be reassigned
    // var - function / local scope - can be reassigned


/*
Why are functions considered first class objects? Remember the 3 abilities?
- Functions can be stored in variables (func expression syntax)
- Passed as an argument (callbacks)
- returned from a different function (closures)
