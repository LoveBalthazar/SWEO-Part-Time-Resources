// what are the different ways of declaring a variable and which one is function (local same thing) scoped?
// - let - block - can be reassigned 
// - const - block -CANNOT be reassigned 
// - var - function/local - can be reassigned

/*
Why are functions considered first class objects? Remember the 3 abilities?
- Functions can be stored in variables (func expression syntax)
- Passed as an argument (callbacks)
- Functions can be returnd from another function (today)
