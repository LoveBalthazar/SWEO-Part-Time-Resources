### Discussion

- FAQ
  - What if my pair is struggling with the material?
    - Pay it forward! Try to explain concepts they struggle with.
    - Play it like you're the Senior Dev and you're helping a Junior Dev
      understand a new concept. It'll be slow, but you can flex those 'explaining muscles'.
  - What if I'M struggling with the material?
    - Be honest. Let your pair know that you're unsure of the material.
    - Be okay with trying things and being wrong.
    - Don't be embarrassed, it's normal.
  - What if BOTH of us are struggling with the material?!? - This WILL happen, and that's fine! The point of projects are to
    actively LEARN, not to already know. Code until you're stuck for > 10 mins, then call a TA in for help.
- Some important notes
  - Set up your switching system and STICK TO IT. Set alarms so you're
    always switching between driver and navigator. Even when a TA comes in
    makes sure you're sticking to the system.
  - If you're more experienced, don't leave your partner in the dust.
    When you go into a job interview, you're going to be asked to explain code,
    so get your practice in now! If you can't say, out-loud, and explain a
    concept to your pair, maybe you don't know it as deeply as you think.
  - If you run into any issues while pairing please let me know. We want to make
    sure everyone feels safe, supported, and productive during pairing sessions.

### Example Pairing: William/Anthony

Today we will just show the interaction between driver and navigator.

Tomorrow we will show the same workflow but using git and github.
