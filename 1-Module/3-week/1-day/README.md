# W3D1

Welcome Back!

We are going to start officially pair programming and also working with local
javascript this week, so get ready for a bit of context switching.

## Warmup Problem - (45m)

> Zip up an array of inputs.
>
> Input === an array of elements.
>
> Output === an array of subarrays containing the the element and an index marker.
>
> Examples:
>
> I: `[1,2,3,4]` -> O: `[[0,1], [1,2], [2,3], [3,4]]`
>
> I: `["Tom", "William", "Phillip"]` -> O: `[[0, "Tom"], [1, "William"], [2, "Philip"]]`

While you are working through this problem in your breakouts rooms solo, we will
be popping through rooms to ensure that your local js enviornment is correctly
set up. If you finish early I reccomend trying to work on some of the harder
problems from week 2 saturday that you feel you need more work on.

After the time is up we will come back to the main room to do a walkthrough.

## Discussion (20m)

- FAQ
  - What if my pair is struggling with the material?
    - Pay it forward! Try to explain concepts they struggle with.
    - Play it like you're the Senior Dev and you're helping a Junior Dev
      understand a new concept. It'll be slow, but you can flex those 'explaining muscles'.
  - What if I'M struggling with the material?
    - Be honest. Let your pair know that you're unsure of the material.
    - Be okay with trying things and being wrong.
    - Don't be embarrassed, it's normal.
  - What if BOTH of us are struggling with the material?!? - This WILL happen, and that's fine! The point of projects are to
    actively LEARN, not to already know. Code until you're stuck for > 10 mins, then call a TA in for help.
- Some important notes
  - Set up your switching system and STICK TO IT. Set alarms so you're
    always switching between driver and navigator. Even when a TA comes in
    makes sure you're sticking to the system.
  - If you're more experienced, don't leave your partner in the dust.
    When you go into a job interview, you're going to be asked to explain code,
    so get your practice in now! If you can't say, out-loud, and explain a
    concept to your pair, maybe you don't know it as deeply as you think.
  - Be honest in your pair reports.

## Example Pair Programming Workflow

Today we will just show the interaction between driver and navigator.

Tomorrow we will show the same workflow but using git and github.
