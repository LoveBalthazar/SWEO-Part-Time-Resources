# W3D3

## Learning Boost (5m)

- Let's hop right into programming!

## POJO Practice (20m)

- [Cat Builder]
- [Iterate Through Obj]

---

## POJO Discussion (30m)

## Git Flow Demo (30m)

- Walkthrough with new repo
- Walkthrough with cloned repo. [Repo to Clone]
- [Git Flow]: Extra git resources.

## Mocha

- Mocha is a testing suite we'll use to test our code

### Using Mocha

- Make sure you're in the folder that contains the 'test' file
- Run `mocha` to run all test files
- Run `mocha -b` to run the test until one fails
- Run `mocha <testFileLocation>` to run a single test
- Run `mocha -g <functionName>` to run all test about a single function

## First Project (Until the end of class)

[Local JavaScript Project]

- Decide who will be driving and who will be navigating. Then the driver will create the github repo AFTER you complete phase One, BEFORE you move on to phase two, and the navigator will clone it.
- When you get to phase 3, make sure you add your zip file to your firstProject directory, so it will be contained within the same github repo.
- Remember to ask questions if you get stuck and follow the rules of pair programming!
- Switch roles every 15 minutes. (use your gitflow to add your work to the staging area, commit your changes, and push to your github repo. Then the other person will pull the changes on their end and continue working on the problems until they repeat the process.)
