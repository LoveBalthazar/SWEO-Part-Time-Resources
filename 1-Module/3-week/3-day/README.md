# M1W3D3

## Plan for today

  1. Practice & Review Lecture
     1. Review Objects
     2. Warm-up Problems
     3. Pair Programming Demo
  2. Plain Old Javascript Project (pair programming)
     1. ONLY ONE PERSON will DOWNLOAD project & UPLOAD to GITHUB
     2. Follow [this guide](https://github.com/appacademy/Module-1-Resources/blob/main/additional_resources/week2/gitflow/README.md#basic-setup-for-pairing) I showed in demo
     3. Pair Programming Etiquette
        1. Avoid cutting each other off when speaking (great learners are great listeners)
        2. Treat others like how we want to be treated
        3. Critique the work, not the person (try to use pronouns like we / I, and talk objectively about the code)
        4. Take turns being Driver / Navigator 
           1. Only one person should be coding (to avoid merge conflicts)
              1. After Driver is done driving:
                 1. Driver: `git add .` | `git commit -m "message"` | `git push`
                 2. Navigator: `git pull`
                 3. switch roles
              2. `git reset --hard && pull` if we accidentally wrote something while not the driver.
           2. switch after each problem OR after 15 minutes
        5. Reach out for help / questions, we're here for ya!

  3. End of Day Review
     1. When to: Memorize vs. Reference
