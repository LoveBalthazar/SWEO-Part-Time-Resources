**Quick Reminder**: Please do not come into the staff room for any reason. That room is ONLY for staff members. If you need something, put a question on the live questions channel for help or send a dm for something more personal. Also, We have to be here for the alotted time that class is in session, so unless there is a legit reason that you need to leave (dr appointment, internet crashed, bad weather), we will not be allowing anyone to leave early.

- Also, if you have a question, please do not send a dm. That is what the live questions channel is for. It's important to use that resource so that both staff members can see the question and help if the other is busy.
