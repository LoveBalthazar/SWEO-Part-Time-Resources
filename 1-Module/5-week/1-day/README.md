## Assessment (1h30m)
- Every multiple choice counts! Doublecheck your answers. You can always use the node to test code, reference homework on AA-Open, BUT NOT NOTES! 

- **VERY IMPORTANT**: run `mocha` before submitting! Any syntax or code failures can result in a zero if `mocha` doesn't work!!

- After you have finished and submitted your assessment, you can verify your submission by clicking `your submission`:

- If you submit like below 5 minutes before assessment ends, we cannot help you. Please start submission process early (preferrably 10 minutes before assessment ends).

### Coding Portion Advice
- If we're stuck, always check the **inputs** and **outputs**, then **write a plan** in english (the what) then implement it (the how) - polya's plan

- If you don't know where to start, ask us a question on live channel to help clarify the prompt even if you think you understood it.

- If we're unable to get started on a question after 10 minutes, don't stare down the code, move on to the next question and come back later.  
  - some coding can be easier than others, I suggest opening all, reading each one and choosing your battle. (small victories will get you momentum!)

- Remember that you have your practice assessment, your projects, and other code problems that you have wrote or solved for reference. (NO NOTES)

- read problem 4 sales tax very carefully and take note of the hint they provide

## String Interpolation

```js
let firstName = "Wes";
let lastName = "Trinh";

let greeting = `Hello, ${firstName} ${lastName}!`;

console.log(greeting);
```
