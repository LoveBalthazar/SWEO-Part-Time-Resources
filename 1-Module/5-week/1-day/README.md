## Assessment (1h 35m)

- Every multiple choice counts! Double check your answers. You can always use Node to test code and reference homework on a/A Open!

- **VERY IMPORTANT**: Run `mocha` before submitting! Any syntax or code failures can result in a zero if `mocha` doesn't work!

### Coding Portion Advice

- If you are stuck, always check the **inputs** and **outputs**, then **write a plan** in english (pseudo-code) then implement it - use Polya's plan

- If you don't know where to start, ask us a question in live-questions channel to help clarify the prompt even if you think you understood it.

- If you are unable to get started on a question after 10 minutes, don't stare down the code, move on to the next question and come back later.  
  - some coding can be easier than others, I suggest opening all, reading each one and choosing your battle. (Small victories will get you momentum!)

- Remember that you have your practice assessment, your projects, and other code problems that you have wrote or solved for reference. (NO NOTES)

- Read problem 4 sales tax very carefully and take note of the hint they provide!
