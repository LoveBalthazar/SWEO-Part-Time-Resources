#### This Week Objectives
- Understand how to debug problems
  - Utilize the debugger
- Be able to solve problems with recursion
  - Understand terminologies like:
    -  base case, recursive case, recursive step
    -  Using recursion to help solve the original problem by...
       -  solving many smaller sub-problems first.
- Know how Immediately Invoked Function Expression works (IIFEs)
- Primitive vs. Reference types. 
  - Objects are reference types and they are mutable
  - Objects are the only type with methods.
- Simple Hoisting of functions, variables, etc.
- Leverage string interpolation to inject javascript 
- Work with big problems and know how to break them down to smaller ones to tackle


#### Priority on what to work on
- Practice Assessment
- Project (problems like #11 flatten and #13 sort)
- All multiple choices for saturday and previous days like formative quizzes.
  - Don't have to do flashcards unless you want to.
- All the warm ups (`code-it-out`) that we did
