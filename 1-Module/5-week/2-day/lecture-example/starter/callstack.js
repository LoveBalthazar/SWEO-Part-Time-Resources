console.log("------------the call stack------------")
// 1. The call stack is a datastructure (stack datastructure)

// 2. JavaScript uses this to keep track of the EVALUATION of FUNCTION CALLS.

// 3. LIFO - last in first out. The most recent function call added (pushed a frame) will be evaluated first until it finishes / has returned (pop the frame)


// Recursion uses a call stack for its calls!
