// We know that the `window` object is the chief object within the BOM with many properties and methods that allow us to work with the window.

// Determine below which window properties or methods are described here. USE MDN!!! (i.e. search window.location)


// 1) Display the host of the current page that the window is viewing (hint: look up `window.location` on mdn, see if you can find a property to do that in there)
// you code here

// 2) Display the page's HTML body
// 

// 3) Shows how many pages are in the current tab's history (hint: look up 'window.history`)
//
