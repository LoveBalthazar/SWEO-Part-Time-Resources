## DOM vs BOM

---

### Browser Object Model (BOM)

- When interacting directly with the browser you are manipulating the browser
object

- `window` object is the global/umbrella object
  - Consists of all the other BOM objects

Common properties include:

- screen
- history
- location
- navigator
- document (this is the DOM)

Common methods include:

- alert
- confirm
- prompt
- open/close

### Document Object Model (DOM)

- Your html page, the document that you are rendering and manipulating
- A collection of nodes (HTML elements) which we can
access and manipulate
- Easy to `console.log` with `window.document` or just `document` as
an alias
