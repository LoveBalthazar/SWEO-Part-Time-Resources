## DOM vs BOM

---

### Browser Object Model (BOM)

When interacting directly with the browser you are manipulating the browser
object.

The browser object you will spend the most time directly working with is the
`window` object. You can `console.log` this object in the dev console and take a
look at all of the methods and properties that are available.

Common properties include:

- screen
- history
- location
- document (this is the DOM)
- ect.

There are tons of interesting things you can affect with this global object,
definitely take some time to explore it in the dev console!

### Document Object Model (DOM)

This is your html page, the document that you are rendering and manipulating.
This is also easy to `console.log` with `window.document` or just `document` as
an alias.

The document object is a collection of nodes (HTML elements) which we can
access and manipulate.
