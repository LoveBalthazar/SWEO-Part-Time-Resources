//window.onload vs DOMContentLoaded

//window.onload - waits until EVERYTHING has loaded. This includes the DOM, images, stylesheet, etc.

//DOMContentLoaded - Only waits for the DOM to fully load

// window.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", (event) => {
//     Element.addEventListener()
// })

// window.onload = () => {

// }

//Event bubbling

//When an event occurs to a specific element, it bubbles up and occurs on its ancestor elements
