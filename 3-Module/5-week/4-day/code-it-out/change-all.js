export const changeAll = function(){
    // 1. Select all elements with the class name of "square".. Use any variable you would like.

    
    // 1.1 This is a very important step and a good way to make sure you've selected something correctly: console.log what you selected in step 1. 
    // i.e. console.log("all box:", allBox); 
    //DOES IT SHOW UP ON OUR BROWSER'S CONSOLE?


    // 2. give a change to all the elements with the "square" class name a border of "5px solid black"; 
    
    //hint: what is the datatype that we have selected in step 1? Is it an element, a collection, etc. If it's an array like collection and we want to apply each change to the items inside it, should we convert the collection to an array first? maybe even use a traditional for loop?

    
    // we should now see all the box have a 5px thick border and it should all be black
