export const addClassPurple = function(){
    // 1. Select all elements with the class name of "square".. Use any variable you would like.
    
    // 1.1 This is a very important step and a good way to make sure you've selected something correctly: 


    // 2. attach to EACH element's class a class name of "purple", look up on mdn `element.classList` to assist you with this. Hint, className selector returns more than one element in a collection.


    
    // after adding purple, the CSS file will have a .purple class that will change the background color of all elements with a class of `purple` to the color purple~
