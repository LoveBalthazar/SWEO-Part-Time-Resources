### Tips
- Content-Type
  - "Content-Type": "text/html"
  - "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"

- to determine the url :
  - if UI exists for the URL: 
    - navigate around the UI of the routes you already know and see if something clicks
  - if UI doesn't exist (since it might not be given in the UI in certain cases):
    - try your best with restful convention to come up with a URL, enter it into the address bar
    - try reading the server file and see which route is the URL we are looking for

## Promises Readings
- Readings on `promises`
- Try out the `Practice: Create and Handle Promises`
