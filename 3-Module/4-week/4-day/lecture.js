// IP
// Internet Protocol
// Have their IP address then you can send information to them
// the information "packets"

// also known as "data packets"
// our headers on the html files
// body with content

// this communication is referred to as "packet switching"

// we split up the data into packets, send them, and then
// reassamble them

// those two common IP versions are IPv4 and IPv6

// IPv4 is the most common one
// how the IPv4 address is represented its by 4 octects which are
// 8 bit binary numbers

// 127.0.0.1
// 0.0.0.0 localhost

// IPv4 supports 4 billion unique addresses

// IPv6 supports 350 undecillion unique addresses (3.5 x 10^38)

// IPv4 has 32 bits while IPv6 has 128 bits

// because IPv6 has more bits it has more notations

// it uses 8 colon hexadecicmal notation: ab:21a:100:2012:89a:f:1:100

// :: localhost

// TCP which stands for Transmission Control Protocol
// its a lot slower in terms of data transmission
// but this guarantees that your data will be intact
// and it guarantees that your data will be in order
// it has preventive measures for corruption of data and loss of data,
// rerunning the connection

// Cons
// its slow
// it uses alot of bandwith
// theres alot of overhead data
// its not great with high latency connections


// UDP -> User Datagram Protocol
// its fast
// it uses low bandwidth
// its efficient in high latency

// Cons
// theres a high chance of data loss
// high chance of corrupted data
// it doesnt guarantee an order of how the data is sent
