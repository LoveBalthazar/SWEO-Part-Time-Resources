# W13D2 - Wednesday
- It's going to be a long day, but fun, hopefully!

## CSS
- The adjective, the skins, the style and position, the `that looks nicer than craigslist` factor.
- 2 main steps in CSS
  - Select what element we want (there are many..many different ways to select)
  - Apply properties w/ values to give it cool styling!
  
## Code-it-out
- Remember: we shouldn't just follow instructions; after each step, take time to analyze and break down what happened.

- `selectors` folder:
  - 1) `basic-single-selectors` folder, open the `instructions.md` and try it out.
  - 2) `combination-selectors` folder:
    - ___try: `adjacent-sibling selector` folder
    - ___try: `compound-and` folder
    - ___try: `descendant-selector` folder
    - ___try: `direct-child-selector` folder
    - ___try: `grouping-many-or` folder
  - 3) `pseudo-class-selectors` folder, open the `instructions.md`

- `properties-typography` folder:
  - `font-exercise` folder try:
    - `instructions-pt1.md`
    - `instructions-pt2.md`
    - `instructions-pt3.md`
