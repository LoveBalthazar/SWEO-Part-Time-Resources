## Practice: Basic Styling (45m)

Spend some extra time with this one playing around with applying different
properties to the elements. This project is purely experimental, use what you
know, and the readings/documentation to make this site look different than it
does unstyled.

## Practice: Wireframe Practice (SOLO)

Take the wireframe you made yesterday and play around with it. Try to make it
look more like the picture, use a different font, choose a color pallette, set
your margins and padding. Experimentation, failure, and more experimentation is
the only way to learn css, try to have some fun with it!

## Office Hours

I will mess around with the basic styling project and just apply some random
styling choices.
