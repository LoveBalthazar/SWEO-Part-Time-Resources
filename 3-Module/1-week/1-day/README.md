## `Design and Accessibility`

### **`Design`**

[Dieter Rams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Rams)'s 10 principles for good design:

Good design:

- is innovative
- makes a product useful
- is aesthetic
- makes a product understandable
- is unobtrusive
- is honest
- is long-lasting
- is thorough down to the last detail
- is environmentally friendly
- is minimal

**This is `not` a design course, however we will include a few design principles to keep in mind when building websites.**

- `White Space`
  - Leaving empty space around text, images, and interactive elements is a good way to keep things looking clean and increase legibility and usability.
- `Colors`
  - Color should be used to convey meaning and to make the content easy to read.
  - Your colors should complement each other, not clash.
  - Use something like the [Adobe color wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) or [Google's Material Design Docs](https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html) to help you choose.
  - Your colors should be easily distinguishable, even for the color blind. You can use the [color-blindness simulator](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/) to help you decide what colors to use.
- `Typography`
  - Choosing readable fonts is very important!
  - Two types of fonts are important:
    - `Serif`
      - Serif's are the small strokes on the ends of letters in fonts like Times New Roman, Palatino, and Georgia.
      - Improve readibility of text blocks, used in newspapers and early books.
      - still used to improve long-form readability.

    - `Sans-serif`
      - These have no serifs. They are minimal and clean, examples include Helvetica, Arial, and Verdana.
      - Ideal for single words or short-form phrases like headlines, icons, and navigation.
      - Usually used with larger text size.

### **`Accessibility`**

- *`Accessibility is a big part of the design process`*
- use the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) to ensure that your website is accessible to everyone.

The `four principles of WCAG` 2.1 are:

- `Perceivable`
  - HTML is structure in a way that reflects a heierarchy, sequence or relationships.
  - Color is used to convey meaning.
  - Avoid using images of text, since they can't be read by screenreaders.
- `Operable`
  - The user can perform all operations using a keyboard.
  - All nav links should be clearly labeled.
  - Targets for user interaction are large enough to be user friendly.
- `Understandable`
  - Web page specifies its language
  - Clear error messages
  - Predictable nav patterns
- `Robust`
  - All elements have unique IDs
  - All HTML syntax is correct with appropriate nesting and opening and closing tags.

You can use this [Accessibility Checker](https://www.accessibilitychecker.org/) to determine the accessibility of different websites.

**You're not expected to be come an accessibility expert here**. Most of the time your company will work with a UI/UX designer that will help with accessibility.
