# W13D1 - Monday

## Assessment (1h15m)
- 2 hr 20m
  
- 7 MC; 12 Specs; 
  - Passing score: 15/19

- Remember that these are `also available resources`:
  - practice assessment
  - any code you've written on `coding problems` like `code-it-outs` that you've done.
  - Formative quizzes on AA open
  - Homework and readings on AA open
  - MDN
  - drawing or diagram tool (has to be blank no previous tabs or work)

- Don't hesitate to ask questions if something is confusing or we require clarity! We cannot help you code, but we can explain the question and point you to available resources.

### Coding Portion
- bit more edge cases, i.e. conditions to check certain things, or keep track of certain data (for ex, island project kept track of size), etc.
- Write Comments! i.e. the steps we need to take for the traversal(pop node, then do the thing, etc.)

- PLEASE: `DO SOME BUG PREVENTION`!!
  - Don't just write everything out and then test
  - `TEST EACH unit` that we finish i.e:
    - 1) after finishing finding `north` neighbor, 
    - 2) add comment for what `we expect` (i.e should give node of [n,n]) 
    - 3) run an example, log data, and analyze what `we actually got instead`


- DO NOT Copy and paste from previous project, solutions, etc. It will create more mess than help. 
  - (think about the process of problem solving, not how we can do something hacky w/ something else)
