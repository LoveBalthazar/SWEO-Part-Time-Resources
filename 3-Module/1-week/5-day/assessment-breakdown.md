# Assessment Week 13 Breakdown
- Topics: Design Principles, HTML, CSS, 
- MDN will be a good reference tool here!
- On the assessment, if you're not sure what to do after reading the question, `Ask a question`, we can help clear up the prompt

## Basic Design Principles
- [reading link](https://open.appacademy.io/learn/js-py---pt-apr-2022-online/week-13---html-and-css/design-principles)
- Common ones to understand
  - `White Space`
  - `Colors`

  - `Conventions`
- Given an image of a snippet of a website, determine which principle fails here (i.e. not enough white space, misuse of colors, etc.)


## HTML

- HTML Semantics
  - Elements
  - Tags
  - Attributes
  - Understand when to use which element
    - MDN is your friend here, look up elements we do not know!
    - I.e. what element should we use for text w/ link? (anchor element -> `a` tag )


## CSS

### CSS Selectors
- [reading link](https://open.appacademy.io/learn/js-py---pt-apr-2022-online/week-13---html-and-css/css-selectors)

- Different Selectors and combinations we covered

- CSS Selector Order Specificity
  - inline, id, classes, tags, etc.
  - be able to determine which selector / combination is prioritized
  - given a combination of selectors, calculate which one has priority
    - i.e. "ul li" vs. "div.ele #item"

- Given this prompt... use x selector (like descendant) to  change y...

- Definitely go over the `code-it-out` we did for selectors, plenty of questions on this topic.
