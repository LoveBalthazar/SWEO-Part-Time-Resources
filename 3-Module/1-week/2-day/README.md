## HTML, CSS, JS

Webpages are comprised of three major components: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

* **HTML**: Page structure, layout, content
* **CSS**: Look and feel, styling and positioning (includes moving layouts and structure)
* **JavaScript**: Interactivity, utility

You can think of a webpage like a house. HTML is the frame, rooms, and
foundations. CSS is the paint, flooring and finished surfaces. JavaScript is
the plumbing, electrical wiring and internet connection.
