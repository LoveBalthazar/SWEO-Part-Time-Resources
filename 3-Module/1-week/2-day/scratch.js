//Cypress
//Cypress is a tesing framework used for anything that runs in the browser

//WCAG
//Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

//4 main principles of WCAG 

//1. Perceivable - All information and UI components should be presented in a way
// that all users can perceive
// example - We're using to display important information (text is highlighted in red) we have
//     to find other ways to show this importance for colorblind people as well
// example 2 - For blind people we have to make sure our html has adequate screen readers
//     so they can access the content as well

//2. Operable - All UI components and navigation must be operable by all users
// Example - Anything you can do with a mouse you should also be able to do with a keyboard
// example - All nav links should be clearly labeled as to where they take you
// example - All buttons, hyper links, and other targets should be large enough so everyone can see them


//3. Understandable - All ui components and the information they hold should be understandable
//      by all users
//example - The webpage should specify it's language so the browser can translate it
// example - All error messages should be clear and understandable (specifically to non software engineers)
//example - clear instructions

//4. Robust - Content must be robust enough to be interpreted by a wide variety
//    of user agents, or assistive technology
// example - All html elements must have unique ids which helps assistive technologies interpret
// example - All html syntax is correct

//Make sure you're taking advantage of HTML and CSS docs (MDN has great docs)

//Basics of HTML
//Hypertext Markup Language

//HTML has three components that form its building blocks
//TAGS, ELEMENTS, ATTRIBUTES

//TAGS: 
//Opening and closing tag

//<h1 "anything we put in here will not be displayed in the browser" >  I will be displayed in the browser  </h1>

//<h1 id="attribute">Welcome to my blog bro</h1>

//ELEMENTS
//An elements is EVERYTHING between the tags and including the tags

//ATTRIBUTES
//USed to define additional information about our element
//Usually come in name="value" pairs
//Examples

/*
<img src="assests/image.jpg"></img>
<h1 id="beepboop"></h1>
*/
//<h1 id="beepboop"></h1>

//Comments in HTML : 
//      <!-- boing boing -->

//Wireframe 
//Similar to a building blueprint but for a webpage

//How do HTML, CSS, and JS interact

//HTML is like the skeleton of a webpage - the layout (WHERE everything goes)

//CSS is the styling of a wepage - (LOOKS - how does it look? is it purple?)

//JAVASCRIPT - is the functionality (WHAT DO THINGS DO)
