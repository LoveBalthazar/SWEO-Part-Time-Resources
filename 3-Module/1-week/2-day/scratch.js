//Cypress
//Cypress SUCKS 
//Cypress is a testing framework specifically for things that run in the browser

//Accessibilty
//Making sure colorblind, blind, deaf, and people with mobility issues
//can access our website

//WCAG - Web Content Accessibility Guides
//Guidelines we use to build accessible content

//4 Main Principles of the WCAG guidelines

//1. Perceivable - All information and UI components must be presented in a way
// that all users can perceive
//example - Screen readers for blind people
//example - When using color to emphasize something we have to find other 
//     ways as well for colorblind people to see it as well
// example - Don't use images as text as screenreaders can't read that

//2. Operable - All UI components and navigation must be operable by all users
//example - any operation that can be performed with a mouse should also be
// able to be performed with a keyboard
//example - all navigation links should be clearly labeled as to what they are
// example - buttons, hyperlinks, and any other targets should be large enough
// for every one to see

//3. Understandable - The UI and the info it holds must be understandable
//example - The website specifies its language whhich supports translation
// to other languages
//example - clear error messages
//example - predictable navigation, clear instructions

//4. Robust - Content must be robust enough to be interpreted by a wide variety
//of user agents and assistive technology
//example - All elements must have a unique id attribute
//example - Make sure all HTML syntax is correct

//Basics of HTML!!!
//Hypertext Markup Language

//HTML is made of three components
//those three are TAGS, ELEMENTS, ATTRIBUTES

//TAGS
//<html></html>
//Tags are denoted by opening and closing angle brackets
//<h1 "anything in here won't be displayed">I will be displayed </h1>

//ELEMENTS
//An element is everything between AND INCLUDING the opening and closing tags

//ATTRIBUTES
//Used to define additional information about the element
//Usually come in name="value" pairs
//You can only use double quotes for attributes

//<img src="assets/image.jpg"/>
//<h1 id="header" class="" >WILL BE REVERSED</h1>

//HTML, CSS, JS

//HTML - The layout of the webpage (WHERE do things go)

//CSS - the syling of the webpage (How do things LOOK)

//JS - The functionality (What do things DO)
