### Option 1: Build Your Own CSS Framework!
1) download the `CSS-Long-Practice` starter on aa-open. 
2) open `clone-optons.js` and think of an application from there that you're planning to clone the functionality of for `your future first project`
   - I.e. `soundcloud`
3) Think of a theme that you want to base the application around
   - I.e. `soundcloud` like website but for retro classic video game songs 
   - I.e. `flickr` like website but for horror post apocalyptic images
   - other themes/topics/genres example: space, futuristic, mobile, animal, food, mordern urban city, anime, game, etc.
4)  go to those websites that we like a lot for inspiration or checkout css frameworks

5) Create your own CSS theme
    - i.e. for my `souncloud` clone it will be for retro classic video game songs, so my CSS Framework might look something like this:
      - https://nostalgic-css.github.io/NES.css/
    - Download the starter and create a few basic components!

### Option 2: If you just want practice coding/styling
If you are feeling overwhelmed and would just like to practice your `css styling` skills, then that's fine too! Follow below: 

1) download the `CSS-Long-Practice` starter on aa-open.   
2) open `clone-optons.js` choose an application that you would like to clone in your future project
   1) i.e. `airbnb`, `flickr`, `behance`

3) Eyeball the site's buttons, headers, card, etc. and recreate that in your framework folder.
   1) I.e. go on `amazon` select a component like the `button` and replicate it
   2) This will provide really good practice
