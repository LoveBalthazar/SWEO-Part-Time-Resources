### Build Your Own!
1) open `clone-optons.js` and think of an application from there that you're planning to clone the functionality of.
   - I.e. `soundcloud`
2) Think of a theme that you want to base the application around
   - I.e. `soundcloud` like website but for retro classic video game songs 
   - `flickr` like website but for horror post apocalyptic images
   - i.e. space, futuristic, mobile, animal, food, mordern urban city, anime, game, etc.
3)  go to those websites that we like a lot for inspiration or checkout css frameworks
