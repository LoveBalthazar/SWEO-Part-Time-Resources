# W14D3 - Wednesday
- CSS Grid! Layout system similar to flexbox, but it's more flexible in a sense that it allows us to work more with both rows and columns (two dimension).

## Practice: CSS Grid
- Reference homework `Grid layout part 2` and `Grid layout part 3`

## Discussion

## Practice: CSS Grid
- Practice, practice, practice!
- Delete, download project again, read instructions, but this time try it without needing to reference solution!
- We saw me code out the solution and understood it, but can we confirm that we can do it ourselves?

## AA Times Project
- Work on each phase (if you get through phase 1 by the end, you're in good shape)
- Project is long, but it's a good one to work on our time!!
