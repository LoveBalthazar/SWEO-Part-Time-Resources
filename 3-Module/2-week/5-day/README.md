## Continue Working on `AA-Times` (1hr)
- Push your `AA-times` to Github if you haven't yet or if you are not the owner
- **IMPORTANT:** if you paired for the project, and your partner owns the repository, you'll need to upload the project to a new remote repository
  - 1) Create a new github repository
  - 2) Copy the remote `url`
  - 3) in the `aa-times` project run `git remote set-url origin YOUR-NEW-URL-HERE` to redirect your local project repository to be linked to the new one.
  - 4) Then `git push`
  - 5) If you need help, raise a hand in slack!

## SOLO Practice: Deploy a Static Project (30m)
