# Topics: HTTP, HTTP Request Components, HTTP Response Components, Restful conventions, Servers

## Navigate around the Dev Tool's (especially the `Network` tab) || Postman

## Restful Conventions
- Be able to apply ReSTful conventions to write out url path that is conventional
- Important as there might not be a UI provided to give the URL Path, so you'll have to either use ReST or parse the server files to find the URL to test

## HTTP `Request` and its Components

## HTTP `Response` and its Components

## Understand Form Submission
- Good for understanding how majority of `POST` requests are made

## Servers
- Understand basic server concepts
- Read through a server file and understand the routing, the request object, and the response object to help determine things like the URL path and response components


## Tips
- to determine the url:
  - if UI exists for the URL: 
    - navigate around the UI of the routes you already know and see if something clicks
  - if UI doesn't exist (since it might not be given in the UI in certain cases):
    - try your best with ReSTful convention to come up with a URL, enter it into the address bar
    - try reading the server file and see which route is the URL we are looking for
