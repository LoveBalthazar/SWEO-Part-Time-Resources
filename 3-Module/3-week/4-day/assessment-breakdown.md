## Restful Conventions
- [Reading Link](https://open.appacademy.io/learn/js-py---pt-apr-2022-online/week-15---http--rest--and-servers/restful-routes-convention)
- Be able to apply RESTful conventions to write out url path that is conventional
- This is extremely important as there might not be a UI provided to give the URL Path, so you'll have to either use RESTful or parse the server files to find the URL to test.

## HTTP `Request` and its Components

## HTTP `Response` and its Components

## Understand Form Submission
- Good for understanding how majority of `POST` requests are made

## Servers
- [Reading Link](https://open.appacademy.io/learn/js-py---pt-apr-2022-online/week-15---http--rest--and-servers/http-node-js-package)
- Understand basic server concepts
- Read through a server file and understand the routing, the request object, and the response object to help determine things like the URL path and response components.


## Tips
- to determine the url :
  - if UI exists for the URL: 
    - navigate around the UI of the routes you already know and see if something clicks
  - if UI doesn't exist (since it might not be given in the UI in certain cases):
    - try your best with restful convention to come up with a URL, enter it into the address bar
    - try reading the server file and see which route is the URL we are looking for


## Focus Points
- Practice Assessment (alot less problems than assessment and easier)
