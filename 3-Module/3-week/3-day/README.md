## HTTP Basics Long Practice
- Similar to what you will be doing on the assessment
  
- Steps (look at documentation for full)
  - `1st`: write out our documentation (`DO NOT do any of step 2, until we finish step 1`)
    - method, url path, headers, body
    - note: Headers contain many keys, but for this exercise focus on **Content-Type** and **Location**.
  - `2nd`: test using `browser` in the `networks tab` or `Postman`
  - `3rd`: if we got prediction wrong (`1st` step), then update our answer and `ask an instructor questions if we can't understand why`


- This will test our understanding of:
  - `http requests`
  - `http responses`
  - `RESTful routes naming conventions`
