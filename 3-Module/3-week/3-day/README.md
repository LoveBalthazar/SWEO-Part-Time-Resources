# W15D3 - Wednesday


## Review - Exercise: HTML Web Server RESTful Endpoints
- You will have to use RESTful convention
- steps:
  - go into the `restful.md` in `restful-exercise` folder
  - write the endpoints for the rest of the scenarios (**attempt something**)
  - Compare our attempted answer w/ the `solution.md` and check


## HTTP Basics Long Practice
- Really work through the project as it will be reflective and similar to what you will be doing on the assessment
  - **do not feel the need to rush this!! We have all day today for this project, let our each other take our time!!**
  
* Note
    - Headers contain many keys, but for this exercise focus on **Content-Type** and **Location**.


- This will test our understanding of:
  - `http requests`
  - `http responses`
  - `RESTful routes naming conventions`

## Early Homework start
- If extra time is available.
