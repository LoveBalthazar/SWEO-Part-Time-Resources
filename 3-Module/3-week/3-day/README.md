# W15D3 - Wednesday


## Review - Exercise: HTML Web Server RESTful Endpoints
- You will have to use RESTful convention
- go into the `restful.md` in `restful-exercise` folder, write the endpoints for the rest of the scenarios . 
- If we get stuck, reference `solution.md`

## HTTP Basics Long Practice
- Really work through the project as it will be reflective and similar to what you will be doing on the assessment
  
- Steps generalized (look at documentation for full)
  - `1st`: write out our documentation
    - method, url path, headers, body
    - note: Headers contain many keys, but for this exercise focus on **Content-Type** and **Location**.
  - `2nd`: test using `chrome browser` in the `networks tab`
  - `3rd`: if we got prediction wrong (`1st` step), then update our answer and `ask an instructor questions if we can't understand why`


- This will test our understanding of:
  - `http requests`
  - `http responses`
  - `RESTful routes naming conventions`

## Early Homework start
- If extra time is available.
